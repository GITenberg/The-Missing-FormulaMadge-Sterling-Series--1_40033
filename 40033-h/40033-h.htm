<h1>THE MISSING FORMULA</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><br />CHAPTER I
<br /><i>Caught in the Storm</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t hire me to spend a night alone at
Stewart Island! Imagine how lonely and terrifying
it must be for Anne Fairaday!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge Sterling did not give the impression of a
girl easily daunted. Gazing out across the stretch
of ruffled water toward the pine-covered isle
which drowsed like a huge green sea turtle in the
heat of a midsummer sun, she made a most striking
picture. Her auburn hair had been whipped carelessly
back from her face by the wind. She was
tanned to a healthy, mellow bronze, and the blue
of her sweater exactly matched the blue of her
eyes&mdash;eyes which at the moment were troubled and
serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem right for Anne to stay there
without a companion,&rdquo; she continued, addressing
the kindly-faced, elderly woman who stood beside
her at the boat landing.</p>
<p>Mrs. Brady nodded soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We really should do something about it. I had
no idea she was staying alone until Jack French told
us this morning. Of course, the Fairadays always
have kept to themselves. This girl may not care to
have us interfere in her private affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Everything is changed now, Aunt Maude,&rdquo;
Madge protested quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Anne would
have mixed more with folks if her father hadn&rsquo;t
kept her so close at home. Now that he is dead she
needs friends more than ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not go over there this afternoon and find
out how matters stand?&rdquo; Mrs. Brady suggested
quietly. &ldquo;The least we can do is to invite her to
stay here at the lodge until she has had time to plan
her future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge&rsquo;s face brightened and she gave her aunt
an affectionate squeeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d say that! I&rsquo;ll start this very
minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She promptly untied a canoe moored at the landing
but before she could launch it two men with
axes swung over their shoulders came down the
shore trail. Recognizing Mr. Brady and Old Bill
Ramey, the man-of-all-work about the lodge,
Madge was in the act of stepping into the canoe
when her uncle hailed her.</p>
<p>She did not attempt an answer but waited until
he drew nearer the landing. He came at a brisk
pace, carrying his fifty-two years with a jaunty
vigor that was the envy of many a younger man.
His ruddy cheeks were framed in a healthy tan acquired
by a life-long devotion to the out-of-doors
and his alert, blue eyes snapped with the joy of
being alive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where away, Chick-a-dee?&rdquo; he inquired with
interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d paddle over to Stewart Island,&rdquo;
Madge informed. &ldquo;Do you want the canoe, Uncle
George?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re welcome to it, only I wonder if you
noticed the clouds.&rdquo; Mr. Brady turned to survey
the horizon. &ldquo;It looks to me as though a storm may
blow up. It probably won&rsquo;t amount to much but
I believe you&rsquo;ll be safer in the skiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother!&rdquo; Madge grumbled, casting an aggrieved
glance at the boat. &ldquo;It would take me all
day to get over to the island in that cumbersome
thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a brief study of the sky she thought better
of it and reluctantly launched the skiff. She bent
to the oars and with practiced skill sent the craft
skimming over the water. Rounding the point, she
lost sight of her aunt and uncle who had turned
back toward the Brady lodge.</p>
<p>Madge had arrived at Loon Lake only three days
before, but already she found herself slipping naturally
back into the easy, carefree ways of a wilderness
environment. She sniffed the fragrant balsam
air contentedly and allowed the boat to drift while
she watched a long-necked crane sail majestically
over the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wish the summers were years and years
long,&rdquo; she thought wistfully. &ldquo;I could live here
forever and never tire of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge always looked forward to the vacations
spent at the Brady&rsquo;s Canadian fishing lodge, located
on secluded Lake Loon, in a timber berth twenty
miles from the nearest town of Luxlow. During
the remaining nine months of the year, she lived
with her aunt and uncle at Claymore, Michigan,
but since Mr. Brady was an enthusiastic fisherman,
each summer saw the trio headed northward.</p>
<p>Madge regarded Mr. and Mrs. Brady as parents
for her mother had died when she was a baby and
a short time later, her father, Graham Sterling had
gone West on a prospecting expedition, never to be
heard from again. Although the Bradys had built
their lodge for private use, they had been induced to
open it to a small number of select guests who appreciated
good food and excellent fishing. Madge
did not mind the extra work which fell to her lot
since she always had time for the things she enjoyed.
She liked all outdoor sports. She swam like a fish
and was an expert with a canoe. Then too, she had
a special talent for making friends and knew everyone
in the vicinity of Loon Lake, including the
guides, the tourists and the forest rangers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>Jack French, a handsome young ranger at Lookout
48, had not been slow in meeting Madge. He
had taught her how to handle a canoe, where to look
for bass and how to make a fire without matches;
from him she had learned the names of trees and
strange shrubs. He teased her too and laughed
when she accused him of treating her as a child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just you wait!&rdquo; she had stormed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll grow up
one of these days&mdash;and when I do&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when you do,&rdquo; he had picked her up, but
with an undercurrent of seriousness, &ldquo;well, then I
guess it will be time for Jack French to watch out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge caught herself gazing intently toward the
lookout station visible on a distant hillside. Jack
had called at the lodge only that morning yet somehow
he had seemed changed, more reserved. He
had tried to tease her in the old manner, but his
kidding had lacked its usual carelessness.</p>
<p>During the three summers spent at Loon Lake,
Madge scarcely had spoken a dozen words either
to Anne Fairaday or her father. Often she had
gazed speculatively at the fine home they had built
upon Stewart Island, wondering why the two were
so aloof. It was generally known that Mr. Fairaday
was a noted chemist who had come North for his
health and the belief was that Anne remained close
at home to care for him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now that he&rsquo;s gone I hope she&rsquo;ll agree to stay at
the lodge,&rdquo; Madge thought as she sent the skiff
smoothly through the water. &ldquo;I believe we&rsquo;d become
friends if we could ever really meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was pleasant on the lake with the sun half-hidden
under a cloud. More often than she realized,
Madge rested on her oars to watch queer insects
swimming in the water or birds winging low in
search for fish.</p>
<p>She had covered little more than half the distance
to Stewart Island, when abruptly, she ceased rowing.
Toward the south shore of the lake, a red
canoe could be seen cutting through the water at a
lively rate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Anne Fairaday now!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s she going, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later she saw the girl head directly for
the main landing, apparently to obtain mail and
supplies which were left there for her by the forest
rangers or old Bill Ramey who made weekly trips
to town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s too far away to hail,&rdquo; Madge decided.
&ldquo;Unless I catch her as she returns to the island, I&rsquo;ll
have made my trip for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a brief mental debate, she again snatched
up the oars, rowing steadily toward a rocky point
on the south shore. It had occurred to her that
while she awaited Anne&rsquo;s return she could busy herself
resetting her uncle&rsquo;s minnow trap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>She crossed the lake and located the wire trap
which had floated a short distance from its usual
place. After baiting it with some bread which her
uncle kept in a box under the boat seat, she
anchored the trap in shallow water near the rocks.</p>
<p>Glancing up from her work, she was startled to
see how dark it had grown. Dark clouds were rolling
up fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in for a real storm,&rdquo; she told herself uneasily.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it would come up so quickly.
Guess I&rsquo;d better not wait for Anne. Unless I strike
for home, I&rsquo;ll be caught in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A low, ominous roll of thunder warned her that
she must act quickly if she wished to reach the
mainland ahead of the rain. She turned the boat,
and began rowing with all her strength. The
breeze had quickened noticeably. As she passed
beyond the lee of the point, waves struck the bow
of the skiff with great force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle George was wise to make me take the
boat,&rdquo; she told herself grimly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to be out
in a canoe in these waves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought of Anne and glanced anxiously
toward the far landing. The red canoe had turned
back toward Stewart Island. Apparently, Anne
realized the danger and she too was trying to race
the storm. Her paddle slashed into the water with
vicious force, but she made slow progress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>It was only a matter of minutes now until the
storm would break. Madge cringed as a vivid flash
of lightning zigzagged across the sky to illuminate
an ugly mass of dark clouds. She was more afraid
for Anne than for herself. She knew that the skiff
would carry her safely ashore but the Fairaday girl
was far from expert in handling her canoe and
when the wind strengthened, she could easily be
thrown crosswise to a wave and upset.</p>
<p>Each pull of the oars carried Madge nearer the
girl. Already she could see that Anne was in grave
danger. The waves were buffeting the canoe about
like a log in a whirlpool.</p>
<p>Looking ahead toward the shoreline, Madge saw
a sheet of white mist drop like a curtain upon the
water. The rain was coming!</p>
<p>The murmur of the wind in the trees along the
far shore had increased to an angry whine and
branches began to bend and thrash wildly about.
Madge braced herself for what she knew must
come.</p>
<p>Another flash of lightning brightened the sky
and at the same instant a deluge of rain descended,
blotting out the shore. Madge worked desperately
to keep the skiff from being swamped by the huge
waves which were churned up. The wind howled
in her ears, the rain slashed at her face. For several
minutes she lost sight of the red canoe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>Then as the first onslaught of the storm seemed
to have spent itself, the wind dropped and the rain
fell in a steady downpour. Madge peered anxiously
ahead, searching for Anne.</p>
<p>She sighted the canoe less than twenty yards
away. Relief gave way to fear as she realized that
Anne was struggling frantically to hold her own.
Each time the canoe fell into a trough of a wave,
Madge expected to see it dive for the bottom of
the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on! I&rsquo;m coming!&rdquo; she shouted encouragingly
although she knew her voice could not carry
half the distance.</p>
<p>Anne turned her head and at that very moment
a huge wave descended upon her, catching her unaware.
She made a valiant effort to maintain control,
but failed. The mischievous wave lifted the
canoe high, then tumbled it over on its side!</p>
<p>Madge heard a shrill cry of terror which was
abruptly smothered out. The canoe floated free
but Anne was not clinging to its side. She had disappeared.</p>

<p>M<span class="sc">adge</span> worked grimly at the oars as she endeavored
to reach the overturned canoe. What had
become of Anne? With a fast beating heart, she
watched the water for a glimpse of the girl.</p>
<p>She had nearly given up hope when she caught
sight of a struggling form not far from the floating
canoe. A hand emerged, only to sink again beneath
the surface. Anne could not swim!</p>
<p>The realization drove Madge to even greater exertion.
The next powerful sweep of her oars carried
her near the struggling girl. She thrust out an oar,
but Anne either failing to see it or lacking strength
to grasp it, fluttered her hands weakly and went
under again.</p>
<p>Without an instant&rsquo;s hesitation, Madge kicked
off her pumps and plunged over the side of the skiff.
Three long crawl strokes carried her to the place
where Anne had submerged. Bending sharply at
the waist she shot down in a surface dive. Groping
about under water, she searched frantically for the
body and could not find it. She was forced to the
top for air but she went bravely down again and
this time her hand touched Anne&rsquo;s hair. She grasped
it firmly, lifting the girl to the surface.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>Anne was only semi-conscious but as she gulped
air it gave her strength to renew her struggles.
Madge hooked her firmly under the jaw and did not
relax her hold. The waves beat down mercilessly
upon the girls and each time the avalanche of water
poured over their heads. Anne fought like a wild
thing. Madge, encumbered by heavy clothing,
found the battle exhausting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your breath when you see a wave coming,&rdquo;
she advised. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t struggle or we&rsquo;ll both drown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne relaxed slightly and Madge managed to
shift her into position for a safe carry. Using a
powerful scissors kick and a one arm pull, she towed
her slowly toward the skiff which had been carried
some distance away.</p>
<p>Madge was nearly exhausted when they finally
reached the boat and it discouraged her to know
that the most difficult part of the rescue lay ahead.
They must climb aboard the skiff, and unless they
balanced it perfectly it would upset. The only
alternative was to cling to the side until help came.</p>
<p>Madge glanced hopefully toward shore but she
could not even see the Brady lodge and the rain
likewise hid the lookout from view. Even should the
storm abate, it might be fifteen minutes or an hour
before Uncle George or Old Bill started out to
search. She doubted that they could hold out many
minutes in the cold water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You must do exactly as I say,&rdquo; she ordered
Anne. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swim to the other side of the boat. When
I give the word we must both climb in at the same
time. If we don&rsquo;t work together, the boat will upset
and then we&rsquo;ll be in a real pickle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Anne half sobbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you can. Do exactly as I say and we&rsquo;ll make
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne nodded that she understood what was expected
but Madge wondered if she really had the
strength to obey. She swam to the other side of the
skiff and at her signal both girls slowly raised themselves
up from the water. The boat wobbled dangerously
but Anne appreciated the need for caution.
Working deliberately, they kept the skiff upright
until both were safely over the edge. Exhausted by
the effort, Anne sank down in a little heap on the
bottom, shivering from nervous excitement and
cold. Madge resisted the temptation to drop down
beside her and snatched up the oars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make for the island!&rdquo; she cried, above the
roar of the wind. &ldquo;If we can reach the cove, the
waves won&rsquo;t be so high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The center of the storm appeared to have passed
over, yet gigantic breakers continued to lash against
the boat. The steadily falling rain made it difficult
for Madge to see where she was going and she depended
largely upon her instinct for direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let me help,&rdquo; Anne presently offered, realizing
that she was not doing her share.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re almost there,&rdquo; Madge returned without
giving up the oars.</p>
<p>One glance at her companion assured her that
Anne was in no condition to assist. She was a frail
girl but rather pretty in spite of her bedraggled appearance.
Her hair was dark and straight and her
features were as regular as those of a statue. Madge
judged her to be sixteen or seventeen but it was
difficult to guess accurately for Anne&rsquo;s sober expression
undoubtedly made her look older than she
actually was. Her face was drawn and strained and
she appeared to be still suffering from the shock of
her mishap.</p>
<p>A few minutes later they reached the sheltered
side of Stewart Island and a flash of lightning disclosed
the curving shore line. As the oars struck
bottom, the girls scrambled out into the water
which came only to their knees, dragging the skiff
out upon shore where the waves could not reach it.
They made a quick dash for the house.</p>
<p>In the semi-darkness it looked gloomy and depressing.
It was a large, rambling affair, more like
a hotel than a house, and not at all in keeping with
the type of shack or cabin usually erected in the
North. Branches of a tall birch tree brushed against
the pointed roof and the wind whined most distressingly
around the many corners of the building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d not enjoy coming here alone at night,&rdquo;
Madge thought.</p>
<p>Her companion opened the kitchen door and
they stomped in out of the rain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fire in the library grate,&rdquo; Anne chattered,
leading the way to an adjoining room. &ldquo;Thank
goodness I built it before I left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They huddled before the glowing embers of the
fireplace and Anne tossed on a fresh log which
quickly blazed up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stand around in wet clothing,&rdquo; she
observed, looking appraisingly at Madge. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
my size. I&rsquo;ll see what I can find for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waiting for her to return, Madge gazed curiously
about the library which was lined to the ceiling
with books. The fireplace gave the room a
cheerful appearance but she could not fail to notice
the threadbare rug, the scanty furniture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;I always understood
the Fairadays were well-to-do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her reflection was cut short by Anne&rsquo;s return.
She had found a change of clothing for Madge who
accepted it gratefully. After hanging up their garments
to dry, the girls made coffee, sipping it
luxuriously before the fire. As they chatted, Anne
brought up the subject of the rescue and in halting
phrases tried to thank Madge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t thank me,&rdquo; the latter protested.
&ldquo;It was nothing. Only if I were you, I&rsquo;d certainly
learn to swim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should,&rdquo; Anne acknowledged ruefully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
always wanted to but never had the chance. Until
lately, Father took so much care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge nodded sympathetically and after explaining
that she had only that day learned of Mr.
Fairaday&rsquo;s death, invited Anne to stay at the Brady
lodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good of you to ask me,&rdquo; the Fairaday girl
murmured, &ldquo;and truly, I would like to accept. Just
now I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t. You see, there&rsquo;s a special
reason why I must stay here&mdash;for a few days at
least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hesitated and did not explain. Madge looked
troubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve written to an aunt in New York and as
soon as things are settled I expect to live with her,&rdquo;
Anne went on hurriedly. &ldquo;I do appreciate your
kindness only I know I&rsquo;ll be safe here. It&rsquo;s lonely but
I&rsquo;m used to that. The one thing that worries me is
<i>what</i> I shall live on after the estate is settled. Father
left only this house and a few hundred dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>Madge was startled by this frank disclosure. The
shabby appearance of the interior of the house had
warned her that the Fairadays were not as wealthy
as rumor would have it, but it was difficult to believe
that Anne faced poverty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father was never practical about money matters.
He built this expensive house and installed a
laboratory on the second floor that would do credit
to a scientific institution. He spent so much on
experimentation too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be proud of the name your father
made for himself,&rdquo; Madge said politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am, and he was a dear, too. But if only
he hadn&rsquo;t been so careless about details! Several
times he made important discoveries, only to let
others reap the commercial reward. Before his death
he worked out some preparation which when applied
to iron and steel prevented rust&mdash;several large
companies were interested in it too. He promised
me faithfully he would register the formula in the
patent office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he kept putting it off. He always said the
formula wasn&rsquo;t perfected. He always assured me no
one could steal it for he kept the experiments to
himself and hid all the data where it would never
be found.&rdquo; Anne laughed shortly. &ldquo;Well, he did a
good job of it! I&rsquo;ve searched this house high and low
and can&rsquo;t find a trace of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re certain the formula is valuable?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo; Anne arose and moved to the
desk, returning with a letter which she dropped into
Madge&rsquo;s lap. &ldquo;Last week this came from the Alton
Chemical Company&mdash;one of the firms Father negotiated
with. You see the letter is signed by the
president of the firm&mdash;G. H. Brownell&mdash;and he says
he is coming here soon to see me about the formula.
If only I had it! I&rsquo;m sure he would pay me a good
figure for it. What became of the thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask me something easy. You searched the
laboratory I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dozen times. I haven&rsquo;t given up though. I
know I&rsquo;ll find it somewhere and I intend to stay
here until I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could help,&rdquo; Madge returned. &ldquo;Aunt
Maude says I have a talent for finding lost things.
She always calls on me when anything is missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then consider that I&rsquo;m calling on you now. We
might start turning the house upside down this
minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge&rsquo;s eye had fallen upon the clock and she
sprang to her feet with an exclamation of dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The search must wait until another day. Goodness!
That clock must have skipped an hour or so!
Aunt Maude will think I drowned in the lake. I
must run. Mind if I wear your dress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. It&rsquo;s only an old rag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the door, Madge hesitated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; she said bluntly, &ldquo;my aunt will be
put out because you feel you can&rsquo;t stay at the lodge.
If anything should go wrong here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be certain, Anne. If you need help at
any time or want to talk with me, fly a white flag
from the boat landing. I&rsquo;ll see it from the lodge if
the day is clear and come as fast as I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Anne agreed, &ldquo;I have an old white
skirt I can use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She accompanied Madge to the beach, helping her
launch the skiff. The rain had ceased falling and the
sky was slowly clearing. Before saying goodbye,
Madge promised Anne that she would have Old Bill
search for the overturned canoe. Anne thanked her
again for her kindness, urging her to return soon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget,&rdquo; she called, as her friend floated
slowly away from the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be likely to forget!&rdquo; Madge chuckled softly
to herself. &ldquo;Even if I didn&rsquo;t like Anne, that missing
formula would be sufficient bait! This has been an
exciting day and unless I miss my guess the fun is
only starting!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><br />CHAPTER III
<br /><i>A Puzzling Letter</i></h2>
<p>Although the sky had cleared, evening shadows
were creeping over the lake. Madge rowed steadily,
knowing that soon it would be dark. She wondered
if her long absence from home had caused worry
and was not greatly surprised when she sighted another
boat on the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Uncle George and Old Bill,&rdquo; she decided.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re out looking for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She waved her hand to assure them she was quite
safe and in a few minutes, Old Bill, with a skillful
sweep of the oars, brought the boat alongside the
skiff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time you&rsquo;re getting back, young lady!&rdquo; Mr.
Brady called out with kindly gruffness. &ldquo;Another
ten minutes and we&rsquo;d have been dragging the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Madge laughed. &ldquo;I thought you had
more confidence in my ability to handle a boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you give me another scare like this, I&rsquo;ll wish
I&rsquo;d never brought you up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge did not take Mr. Brady&rsquo;s brusque manner
seriously for she knew that it masked a kindly heart.
He really had worried about her and blamed himself
for permitting her to start out ahead of the storm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I told Mr. Brady you knowed how to look arfter
yourself,&rdquo; Old Bill broke in, his leathery face
wrinkling into a multitude of tiny folds. &ldquo;I knowed
this storm would pass over quick&mdash;seen a lot of
&rsquo;em in my day, I have. I kin remember when I was
workin&rsquo; on the Great Lakes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind!&rdquo; Mr. Brady interrupted. &ldquo;Tell
us another time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; The old boatman subsided into injured
silence.</p>
<p>Old Bill loved to spin yarns&mdash;that was his particular
failing. He was an inaccurate encyclopaedia
of everything that went on, but only Madge, who
thought him amusing, ever cared to listen.</p>
<p>He could relate the most fantastic tales of his
adventures at Hudson Bay and various lumber
camps. He had served as sailor on the Great Lakes
and as guide to aspiring amateur fishermen who
invaded Ontario, yet his real experiences were as
nothing compared to those of his fertile imagination.
His shack back of the Brady lodge was
cluttered with melodramatic magazines which he
read by the hour. He did as little work as possible
about the lodge, yet if a task struck his fancy, glorified
it until it became a task of gigantic importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Aunt has been worrying,&rdquo; Mr. Brady told
Madge. &ldquo;What kept you so long?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>Madge explained that among other things she had
jumped into the lake and wound up the tale of her
adventure by mentioning the overturned canoe
which had not been recovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go on home,&rdquo; Mr. Brady directed. &ldquo;Bill and
I will see if we can pick it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before continuing toward the lodge, Madge
pointed out the general locality where she thought
the canoe might be found. When she pulled up to
the boat landing a few minutes later, Mrs. Brady,
who had been anxiously watching from the veranda,
rushed down to meet her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re safe!&rdquo; she exclaimed in relief.
&ldquo;I was so worried when the storm came up so
quickly. Why, you&rsquo;ve changed your dress! What
happened and where is Anne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge repeated the story of her adventure, explaining
that Anne did not wish to leave the island.
After a slight hesitation, she related all that she had
learned concerning the strange formula of Mr.
Fairaday&rsquo;s. Mrs. Brady was astonished to hear that
his fortunes had dwindled, but to Madge&rsquo;s disappointment
she did not appear greatly impressed with
the story of the formula.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds like one of Bill&rsquo;s yarns to me,&rdquo; she
laughed. &ldquo;Whoever heard of a chemical preparation
to keep things from rusting? If you find the formula,
Madge, I want you to fix me up a solution
for the kitchen pump! And for that rake your
uncle left out in the rain!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It does sound fantastic, I admit, but somehow,
I think there&rsquo;s something to the story. I do know
that scientists have been trying for years to find a
paint that will prevent rust. Why, it would mean
a fortune to the person who discovered the secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it,&rdquo; Mrs. Brady returned mildly.
&ldquo;I had no intention of trying to discourage you. By
all means help Anne look for the missing paper or
whatever it is, but don&rsquo;t build your hopes too high.
It&rsquo;s very likely the formula never existed save in
old Mr. Fairaday&rsquo;s mind. I&rsquo;ve heard it said that he
was a queer man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge dropped the subject but that was not the
last of it. When Mr. Brady and Old Bill returned a
half hour later with Anne&rsquo;s canoe in tow, Mrs.
Brady repeated the story for their benefit and at
the supper table Madge was subjected to a great deal
of goodnatured teasing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just wait!&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;Anne and I may show
you a thing or two about formulas! If we find it,
the laugh will be on you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She fully intended to return to Stewart Island the
following day, but when she awoke the next morning
it was to find that a drizzling rain had set in.
Everyone stayed close in except Old Bill who was
forced to drive to town for supplies and mail. The
roads were muddy and he did not get back until
after dark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Any letters?&rdquo; Madge demanded eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for you,&rdquo; he told her crossly, pitching a
heavy sack of flour from his shoulder to the kitchen
floor with such violence that it sent up a white
cloud of dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some pie in the oven,&rdquo; Madge said
sweetly. &ldquo;I know you must be hungry and tired.&rdquo;
Her eye had fastened upon a slim, white envelope
protruding from his hip pocket. &ldquo;You <i>do</i> have a
letter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t fer you, I said.&rdquo; Bill spoke more pleasantly
for the mention of pie had softened his ill
temper. He took the letter from his pocket and
holding it to the light, squinted curiously at the
postmark. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for that gal, Anne Fairaday. The
postmaster told me to give it to her. Looks important
too, comin&rsquo; from New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill Ramey!&rdquo; Mrs. Brady interposed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
worse than a rural mail carrier when it comes to
curiosity! Put that letter on the shelf. Madge can
take it over to the island tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill&rsquo;s reply was sufficiently meek but his face
showed plainly that he did not like the order. He
had always carried supplies and mail in person to
Stewart Island or had left it in a covered box at the
main landing across the lake from the Brady lodge.
In previous summers, the Fairadays had tipped him
well for the service.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>After eating the supper Madge prepared for him,
he shuffled out, permitting the kitchen door to slam
behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s peeved,&rdquo; Madge chuckled. &ldquo;Poor Bill! His
feelings are always being hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning dawned bright. Shortly after
breakfast, Madge set out for Stewart Island, towing
Anne&rsquo;s canoe behind the skiff. She had laundered
the dress which had been loaned her and carried it
neatly done up in paper. She would have forgotten
the letter had Mrs. Brady not hurried down to the
beach with it just as she was starting off.</p>
<p>The lake was smooth and Madge made good time
over to the island. Anne had sighted her from afar
and was at the water&rsquo;s edge to meet her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you found my canoe!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;What
luck! But you shouldn&rsquo;t have ironed that dress. It
was only an old one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s something more for you,&rdquo; Madge declared,
producing the letter. &ldquo;Bill brought it from
town last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thanks. Mind if I read it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>Madge busied herself with the skiff while her
friend eagerly ripped open the long white envelope.
Scarcely had her eyes swept the page when she
uttered an exclamation of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madge, do you remember the young man who
worked here on the island about a year ago? I mean
Father&rsquo;s laboratory assistant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That queer fellow with the stoop shoulders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he got that way from spending so much
time bending over test tubes,&rdquo; Anne smiled. &ldquo;I never
liked him very well and was glad when Father discharged
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw him except at a distance,&rdquo; Madge
said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve even forgotten his name. What about
him anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name is Clyde Wendell,&rdquo; Anne supplied.
&ldquo;This letter is from him. He says he&rsquo;s coming here
to see me on important business. Now what can
that mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he give a hint as to what the business
is about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the slightest. Here, read the letter for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge accepted the typewritten sheet and after
scanning it briefly, returned it without comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clyde Wendell knew more about Father&rsquo;s work
than any other person,&rdquo; Anne declared eagerly.
&ldquo;Perhaps he can tell me what became of the formula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wasn&rsquo;t it hidden after he left?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. Father worked on it when Clyde
was here. Then they disagreed. Father thought
Clyde wasn&rsquo;t honest and finally discharged him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think Clyde would know where it
is then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was always interested in the formula, Madge.
And he knew Father&rsquo;s habits even better than I did.
He could always recall what became of his misplaced
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange he&rsquo;d be coming back just at this time,&rdquo;
Madge mused. &ldquo;Especially since he was discharged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Clyde was bitter toward Father at the time
although he was paid several month&rsquo;s extra wages.
He seemed friendly toward me though and he&rsquo;s
likely forgotten all the unpleasantness by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge did not wish to discourage her friend yet
she found it difficult to believe Clyde Wendell would
go far out of his way to be of service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better not pin too much hope on him,&rdquo; she cautioned.
&ldquo;If we get busy we may be able to find that
formula ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given the house a general overhauling but
we can search again. Shall we do it today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s!&rdquo; Madge agreed eagerly. &ldquo;If only you had
a hint as to what became of the thing! I suppose
you&rsquo;ve exhausted every possibility.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so,&rdquo; Anne admitted. She hesitated and
then added: &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s one clue I&rsquo;ve neglected and
it may be important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne smiled mysteriously, and linking arms with
Madge, drew her toward the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><br />CHAPTER IV
<br /><i>A Fruitless Search</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it really isn&rsquo;t much of a clue,&rdquo; Anne
confessed, escorting her friend into the living room.
&ldquo;Just before Father died he tried to tell where he
had hidden the formula but it was hard for him to
speak. The nurse handed him paper and pencil and
he managed to write a few words. He wasn&rsquo;t able
to finish the message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne moved over to the desk and took a scrap of
paper from a pigeon hole. She handed it to Madge,
watching her face closely as she scrutinized the
cramped writing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, this doesn&rsquo;t make sense!&rdquo; Madge protested.
&ldquo;It just says, &lsquo;written in secret&mdash;&rsquo; Is this all of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only three words. I&rsquo;ve puzzled over it until my
head whirls. I&rsquo;ve finally figured out that he was
trying to tell me the formula had been written in
some secret code.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would he have done that? To protect it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Father was obsessed with the idea that
someone wanted to steal the formula, particularly
after his trouble with Clyde. At the very last&mdash;&rdquo;
Anne&rsquo;s voice broke. &ldquo;&mdash;he wasn&rsquo;t quite himself. He
kept calling for some one. &lsquo;Kim&rsquo; he would say,
&lsquo;Kim&rsquo; and looked at me so strangely.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He knew some one by that name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to my knowledge. He probably was delirious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It occurred to Madge that the entire idea of the
formula might have been a delusion as her Aunt
Maude had hinted. Tactfully, she broached the
subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Anne protested. &ldquo;At one time the
formula actually existed and it was an excellent
piece of research&mdash;I know that. I&rsquo;m confident it is
here in the house somewhere. Probably in the most
out of the way place. Since Father took pains to
write it out in code, I&rsquo;m sure he secreted it where
one would never think of searching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then our work is cut out for us,&rdquo; Madge
laughed. &ldquo;If we ever do find the formula we&rsquo;ll still
have the code to unravel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it will be a real one too! Father made a
hobby of codes. Years ago he did work along that
line for the government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge&rsquo;s interest in the missing formula had
somewhat cheered Anne and the girls began their
search of the house with high hope. They spent the
better part of an hour browsing about Mr. Fairaday&rsquo;s
laboratory on the second floor, hunting
through old ledgers and desk drawers. Satisfied that
the lost paper was not to be found there they made
a similar inspection of the old chemist&rsquo;s bedroom,
examining discarded letters and even searching behind
pictures which hung on the walls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We might try the library,&rdquo; Anne suggested at
length. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve looked there of course, but I&rsquo;ve never
gone carefully through the book shelves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They returned to the first floor and undaunted
by the vast array of volumes lining the walls, attacked
the stacks, working on opposite sides of the
room. They went about the task methodically, removing
each book from the shelf and shaking it
carefully to see that nothing had been hidden between
the pages.</p>
<p>Madge experienced a genuine thrill when an
envelope, yellow with age, dropped from a volume
of Keats&rsquo; poems. The girls seized upon it only to be
bitterly disappointed when it turned out to be of
no value.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How provoking!&rdquo; Anne cried impatiently. &ldquo;I
guess you&rsquo;ve wasted your morning, Madge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t consider it wasted,&rdquo; the other corrected
without glancing up from the volume she
was examining. &ldquo;Say, this book looks interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it? Kipling? That particular volume
was Father&rsquo;s favorite. It&rsquo;s a real good story too.
Take it home if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I should since it was your
father&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please do. I know you&rsquo;ll take good care of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, but I&rsquo;ll bring it back in a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep it as long as you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently, Madge said that she must return to
the lodge and Anne accompanied her to the boat
landing. Both were discouraged but tried not to
disclose it to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if we never find the formula, there&rsquo;s one
thing I can always do&mdash;sell this house. Jake Curtis
has been after me to sell it to him ever since Father
died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jake Curtis!&rdquo; Madge exclaimed sharply. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you ever do it. He wouldn&rsquo;t give you half what it&rsquo;s
worth. He has the reputation of being the shrewdest
real estate shark in these parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. He wants to turn the house into a summer
hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And ruin Loon Lake. Imagine this place swarming
with the sort of folks Jake Curtis would attract.
The fishing would be ruined in two seasons!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He practically wants me to give him the place,&rdquo;
Anne informed. &ldquo;You see, he holds a first mortgage
on it&mdash;not a very large one but sufficient to
embarrass me. If the bank will loan me enough
money to pay it off, I&rsquo;ll tell him to jump in the lake.
I&rsquo;d rather sell to anyone but him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When does the mortgage come due?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge had heard her uncle remark that the local
bankers were very reluctant to make loans at the
present time and Anne&rsquo;s prospects appeared especially
slim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wish you luck,&rdquo; she said turning to leave.
&ldquo;Things may straighten themselves out before the
mortgage falls due.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next few days found Madge too busy to
paddle over to the island for three guests arrived
from the city to try their fishing luck. They asked
endless questions, demanded constant service and
had enormous appetites. In spite of the extra housework,
Madge had time to consider Anne&rsquo;s problem
but she could think of no way out. Often too, her
eyes turned toward Lookout 48 but while she frequently
saw Jack French glide by in his canoe he
never stopped at the lodge. Once she saw him carry
a large box of groceries to Stewart Island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has other things to do besides come to see
me,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Why should I care?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet she knew she did care a great deal.</p>
<p>One afternoon toward the end of the week,
Madge was snatching a few minutes rest on the
veranda when the telephone rang. Mrs. Brady answered,
and soon stepped outside to speak to her
niece.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to disturb you, Madge, but a stranger
just telephoned from the White farmhouse. Jack
French is bringing him out from town. He wants
us to put him up for a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend of Jack&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he merely brought him out as an accommodation.
I don&rsquo;t know the stranger&rsquo;s name. He
wants someone to meet him across the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just my luck Uncle George is gone. Isn&rsquo;t Bill
around?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is always missing when there&rsquo;s work to be
done,&rdquo; Mrs. Brady smiled. &ldquo;I think his intuition
warns him. I&rsquo;m sorry to call on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t really mind, providing there&rsquo;s not
more than one suitcase to ferry across,&rdquo; Madge
assured her quickly. &ldquo;And if our guest is a gentleman
he may offer to row back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took her time crossing the lake for there was
no sign of a car at the landing. Beaching the skiff
she sat down on an old log. After a short wait she
heard an automobile pounding down the private
road which joined Loon Lake with the main highway.
Madge arose expectantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>A battered car swung into view and halted with
a jerk. Jack French stepped lightly to the ground.
He was a tall, handsome man, built like an All-American
half-back, strong and straight, his every
movement graceful. His face was richly tanned and
his brown eyes were always a-twinkle, as though the
world amused their owner. One knew at a glance
that he would be restless under a man-made roof.
He loved the canopy of the blue sky, and a wood
or a stream or some rare tree gave him a keener
enjoyment than any artificial diversion could have
done.</p>
<p>He grinned cheerfully at Madge, greeting her
flippantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, child. Here&rsquo;s your new boarder&mdash;guess
you&rsquo;ve seen him before. I packed him out from
Luxlow along with the grub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s gaze lingered half-quizzically as he spoke,
but Madge looked beyond him to the man who was
slowly climbing from the car. It was Clyde Wendell.
The ranger had never liked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe we ever really met,&rdquo; Madge stammered,
slightly embarrassed at the unexpected
meeting. &ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;ve seen you from a distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chemist turned, surveying her rather
sharply. His eyes were penetrating and hostile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Miss Sterling, I suppose? I telephoned
from the White&rsquo;s for a room at Mrs. Brady&rsquo;s lodge.
If you&rsquo;re here to take me across the lake, let&rsquo;s get
started. I&rsquo;ve had a hard trip and I&rsquo;m tired.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>In spite of his desire for haste, the chemist made
no move to lift his suitcases from the rear of the car.
He waited impatiently for the ranger to stow them
in the skiff. Jack was provokingly slow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aiming to do a little fishing?&rdquo; he asked casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll give you a permit. This is a timber
berth, you know and we have to be careful about
fires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I look like I&rsquo;d set one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; Jack returned amiably.
&ldquo;In your case the permit is only a matter of form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why issue it? I lived here several months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack did not respond but wrote out the necessary
form and gave it to him. Clyde took it without a
word of thanks and climbed into the skiff. Madge
looked surprised and then went to the vacant seat
beside the oars. She had expected that the chemist
would at least offer to row across the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Madge,&rdquo; Jack protested quickly. &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t tote those heavy suitcases. I&rsquo;ll bring them over
later tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She would have accepted gratefully had not the
chemist broke in irritably:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bags must go with us. I&rsquo;ll need them before
evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; Madge assured Jack.
&ldquo;Shove us off, will you, please?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>He complied, bestowing a look upon Clyde&rsquo;s
back which was far from complimentary. At first
the skiff moved steadily through the water but
before Madge had covered half the distance her arms
began to tire. Clyde Wendell did not seem to notice.
He stared moodily across the lake. Frequently, his
dark, piercing eyes roved in the direction of Stewart
Island.</p>
<p>The strangely tense expression of his face was not
lost upon Madge. What thoughts could be running
through his mind, she wondered? Why had he returned
to Loon Lake?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for no good purpose,&rdquo; she decided. &ldquo;My
guess is that he intends to make trouble for Anne
Fairaday!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><br />CHAPTER V
<br /><i>Clyde Wendell&rsquo;s Mission</i></h2>
<p>Madge was washing breakfast dishes the next
morning when Clyde Wendell entered the kitchen.
He appeared in a better mood than upon his arrival
and greeted her pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning. I&rsquo;d like to go for a little row on
the lake. Can you let me have a boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what we have,&rdquo; she returned, wiping soap
suds from her hands.</p>
<p>She walked down to the landing with him although
she knew without looking that all of the
boats save one were gone. The skiff had been rented
out earlier that morning to another guest and Bill
had taken one of the boats across the lake to gather
stone for a new fireplace Mr. Brady was building.
That left only a heavy, cumbersome craft which
leaked rather badly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you would prefer to wait until the skiff
comes in,&rdquo; she suggested doubtfully. &ldquo;We seldom
rent out this boat. It&rsquo;s rather heavy and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep it in reserve for yourself, eh?&rdquo; the
chemist interrupted with a knowing laugh. &ldquo;Well,
it looks like a good boat to me and I&rsquo;ll take it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>Madge started to protest then changed her mind.
Without a word, she went to the woodshed and
brought back a pair of oars which she fitted into
the locks. Carelessly, she dropped a tin bucket into
the bottom of the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo; Clyde demanded suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just in case of a leak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chemist should have been forewarned but
the bottom of the boat was dry and he had implicit
faith in his own judgment. Stepping into the craft
he rowed away. Madge smiled as she watched him
strike out across the lake. She returned to her dishes,
but a few minutes later, hanging dish towels on
the back porch, she observed that the boat had
taken a direct course for Stewart Island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what he&rsquo;s up to?&rdquo; she mused. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
believe he wanted me to know he was going over
there to see Anne. I&rsquo;d like to follow him over but
of course that wouldn&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though somewhat ashamed of her curiosity,
Madge kept close watch of Stewart Island all morning.
Toward noon the chemist&rsquo;s boat was sighted
returning slowly across the lake. She was amused
to see that he frequently dropped his oars to bail
water.</p>
<p>Presently, the boat eased to a landing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what do you mean by giving me an old
leaky tub?&rdquo; the chemist called out angrily as he
caught sight of Madge on the veranda. &ldquo;I darn near
drowned!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess the boat does leak a trifle,&rdquo; she admitted
readily. &ldquo;I tried to tell you but you were so determined
not to wait for the skiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t hurt yourself trying to tell me! Look
at my clothes&mdash;wet to the skin. If I hadn&rsquo;t bailed
like all get-out I&rsquo;d have gone to the bottom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boat never entirely fills,&rdquo; Madge corrected
sweetly.</p>
<p>Clyde stalked angrily into the house to change
his wet shoes and garments. Madge tied up the boat,
chuckling at his discomfiture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something must have gone wrong over at
Stewart Island,&rdquo; she thought shrewdly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find
out when I see Anne again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The opportunity was to present itself that very
afternoon. Soon after luncheon, Clyde Wendell
went for a walk in the forest and a short time later,
Madge sighted Anne&rsquo;s familiar red canoe on the
lake. As the girl came toward the lodge, she raced
down to the water&rsquo;s edge to meet her.</p>
<p>Anne looked cautiously about before she beached
her canoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clyde Wendell isn&rsquo;t anywhere near, is he?&rdquo; she
asked in a low tone. &ldquo;If he is, I can&rsquo;t stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He left a half hour ago. What&rsquo;s wrong, Anne?
You look worried.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am. Oh, Madge, everything has gone wrong.
You were right about Clyde. He didn&rsquo;t come here
to help at all. He&rsquo;s the meanest man in the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has he done now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He claims I owe him five hundred dollars. Or
rather, that Father did. He insists that several
months back wages were due him at the time he left
here. It&rsquo;s too ridiculous for words! Actually,
Father paid him extra money to be rid of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you a cancelled check or a receipt to
prove it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing. Father wouldn&rsquo;t bother about a
receipt. Clyde knows that he was more than paid
for his services. I&rsquo;m afraid he thinks I&rsquo;m inexperienced
about business matters and that he can
bluff me into giving him the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne laughed shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No danger of that. I couldn&rsquo;t find five hundred
dollars if my life depended upon it. The only way I
can raise money is to borrow from the bank or sell
my island. And in this country islands are as common
as pine trees and about as cheap!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not such islands as yours,&rdquo; Madge corrected.
&ldquo;Uncle George says you have an ideal location and
the place should bring a tidy sum if sold to the right
party.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Jake Curtis isn&rsquo;t the right party. I&rsquo;m sure
of that. He knows it will be hard for me to pay the
debt I owe him and I think he means to take advantage
of me if he can. I&rsquo;m to see the president of
the First National bank today and ask him for a
loan. Jack said he would take me to town in his car.
Won&rsquo;t you come with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge replied that she should not leave but Anne
coaxed her until she gave in. They crossed the lake
and found Jack waiting with his car. He seemed
well pleased that Madge was to go along.</p>
<p>At Luxlow he dropped the girls at the bank,
promising to call for them in an hour. They entered
the building and Anne was admitted to the private
office of the president. Madge waited outside.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes elapsed before Anne emerged.
The expression of her face disclosed instantly that
the interview had not been successful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; she reported when they were outside
again. &ldquo;He listened politely enough to my story
but he wasn&rsquo;t really interested. When I finished he
said he was sorry he could do nothing for me. It
seems the bank must have sound collateral and I&rsquo;ve
nothing to pledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge tried to cheer her companion, and since
over a half hour remained before Jack would return,
suggested that they go to a nearby drug store
for ice cream. They walked slowly down the street,
gazing at the window displays.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>Suddenly Anne clutched her friend&rsquo;s arm, gripping
it with a hard pressure. With a quick jerk of
her head she indicated a man on the opposite side of
the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Jake Curtis!&rdquo; she said tensely. &ldquo;I hope he
doesn&rsquo;t see me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner had the words been spoken than the
man turned toward the girls. He was a short, stout
individual with ill-fitting, somewhat soiled clothing
and a hard, shrewd face. Before Anne and Madge
could dodge into a store he crossed the street and
confronted them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trying to avoid me, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I wish to avoid you, Mr. Curtis?&rdquo;
Anne countered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s a little matter of a note between
us, y&rsquo;know.&rdquo; He smiled unpleasantly. &ldquo;Aiming to
pay it off by the first, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&mdash;I&mdash;that is, I expect to,&rdquo; Anne stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better think over that proposition I made you.
You&rsquo;ll not find any other person in these parts who
will take the house off your hands. I must warn you
though, I&rsquo;ll expect payment of one kind or another
on the day my note falls due.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bear it in mind,&rdquo; Anne returned coldly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>The girls turned their backs and walked hurriedly
on. Anne was so agitated by the meeting that she
did not care to stop at the drug store so they returned
to the bank there to await Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jake Curtis surely deserves his reputation!&rdquo;
Madge declared in disgust. &ldquo;Oh, Anne, don&rsquo;t ever
sell him your island!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what else I can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Uncle George can find a buyer for you.
I&rsquo;ll speak to him tonight about it. And then we may
locate the formula. That would solve everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack soon returned and the three started for
Loon Lake. Anne who was reticent by nature, made
no mention of her discouraging bank interview,
and although Madge would have liked to acquaint
the ranger with the situation, she felt it was not her
place to bring up the subject.</p>
<p>The sun was low over the lake when the car
finally reached the end of the road. The girls
thanked Jack for the ride and took leave of him.
They crossed over to the lodge in Anne&rsquo;s canoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t stop, Madge. It&rsquo;s getting late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do come in for just a minute,&rdquo; her friend
pleaded. &ldquo;I baked a chocolate cake this morning
and I want you to have half of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne permitted herself to be led toward the
house. Madge quickly wrapped up the cake but
scarcely had she finished than they heard a shout
from the beach. The next instant Old Bill came
hurrying toward the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come quick, folks! An airplane&rsquo;s landin&rsquo; on
the lake. You&rsquo;ll miss it if you don&rsquo;t hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge laughed indulgently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pay any attention, Anne. That&rsquo;s an old
trick of his. He thinks every day is April Fool&rsquo;s.
Think up something better, Bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest, I&rsquo;m not foolin&rsquo; this time,&rdquo; Bill maintained
with a seriousness which left no room for
doubt. &ldquo;Hear it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the girls had caught the unmistakable
drone of an airplane motor. They rushed from
the house, following Bill to the beach, and were in
time to see an amphibian spiral down and land
smoothly on the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you!&rdquo; Bill chortled proudly. &ldquo;It
was three years last month that a mail plane landed
on Loon Lake. Engine must be out of whack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge did not respond though she saw clearly
that the plane was not of the regular mail service.
Nor was it one of the &ldquo;Fire Eagles&rdquo; occasionally
sent out by the Forest Service to scout for fires.
As far as she could tell the plane was disabled in
no way. The steady throb of its motors carried
plainly over the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all things!&rdquo; Madge exclaimed. &ldquo;What
do you think of that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The amphibian was taxiing slowly through the
water, its nose pointed directly toward the beach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><br />CHAPTER VI
<br /><i>Startling Developments</i></h2>
<p>The amphibian coasted slowly in toward the
beach, throttled down its motors and finally came
to a halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me if a Miss Fairaday lives anywhere
on this lake?&rdquo; the pilot called out.</p>
<p>Anne and Madge exchanged startled glances.
The former stepped forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am she.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To her further astonishment, the pilot said a
few words to his passenger, a well-dressed, elderly
gentleman, who immediately climbed from the
front cockpit. He presented his card to Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Brownell from the Alton Chemical Company.
I happened to be this way on a business
trip and thought I&rsquo;d drop in to discuss that matter
which I wrote you about some time ago. By the
way, we didn&rsquo;t hear from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne looked embarrassed and said hesitantly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t had time to write. You see, the formula&mdash;&rdquo;
she trailed off as Madge gave her a warning
look. It would never do to tell Mr. Brownell that
the paper was missing&mdash;not unless she wanted to
throw away her chance of ever selling it to him if
it were found.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If the formula is all your Father claimed it to
be, we may be willing to enter into an agreement
with you,&rdquo; Mr Brownell declared. &ldquo;Now if you&rsquo;ll
just let me see the formula&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t now,&rdquo; Anne returned. &ldquo;You
see I don&rsquo;t live here. My home is at Stewart Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Brownell brushed away her objections with a
careless wave of his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind going there. In fact, if you&rsquo;re
not afraid to ride in a plane, my pilot can take us
both to the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&mdash;you see&mdash;that is, the formula was put
away for safe keeping,&rdquo; Anne stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you haven&rsquo;t it at hand? How soon
can you get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. Perhaps I could write you
later&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve traveled a good many miles to see it.
Fact is, our company is anxious to get just such a
formula as your Father described to us. If you can
get it in a day or so I&rsquo;m of a mind to stay over. I
can send my plane back to the city and return by
train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne was at a loss to know what to say. She
looked doubtfully at Madge who was unable to help
her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make any promise about the formula,&rdquo;
she said after a slight hesitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not dealing with another company, I
hope,&rdquo; Mr. Brownell said quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. Father wrote to several firms, I believe,
but I&rsquo;ve not entered into any correspondence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brownell did not seem entirely convinced.
He debated a minute, studying the lake meditatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any fish here?&rdquo; he questioned abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best fishing lake in this part of the
country,&rdquo; Madge informed quickly. &ldquo;Only this
morning my uncle caught a seven pound bass.
And it put up a magnificent fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d enjoy meeting a bass like that. If I can find
accommodations I&rsquo;ll stay a day or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge suggested that her aunt might take him
in, and arrangements were soon made. As the
amphibian taxied away without its passenger, Clyde
Wendell came down the trail. Anne did not wish
to speak to him and hurriedly took her departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do about the formula?&rdquo; she whispered
to Madge as they said goodbye at the water&rsquo;s
edge. &ldquo;Shall I tell him it&rsquo;s lost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for a day or so,&rdquo; Madge advised. &ldquo;If we
can get him interested in the fishing it will give us a
little time to search. We may find the thing yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>Mr. Brownell had followed Mrs. Brady into the
lodge but Clyde Wendell lingered near the beach.
As Madge turned toward the house he stopped her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name is Mr. Brownell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was he saying to Anne Fairaday just a
minute ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, I think you should ask her,&rdquo; Madge returned
coldly.</p>
<p>She had no intention of telling him Mr. Brownell&rsquo;s
real mission. Before he could ask another
question, she walked away. However, the chemist
was not so easily discouraged and that night at the
supper table, he skillfully drew from Mr. Brownell
the purpose of his visit to Loon Lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re looking for a formula to prevent
metals rusting, you may be interested in an idea of
mine,&rdquo; Clyde suggested. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been working on it
for years. If you have the time, I&rsquo;d like to go into
the matter in complete detail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brownell expressed a keen interest and the
two retired to the veranda, there to talk more privately.
They were still engrossed in deep conversation
when Madge finished the supper dishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that isn&rsquo;t just what you&rsquo;d expect of Clyde
Wendell!&rdquo; she thought in disgust. &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t
care if he took the bread out of Anne&rsquo;s mouth. I
do hope his idea is a flop.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>After a time the two men went to their rooms.
Madge was closing the doors for the night when
she heard the faint put-put of a motor boat, far out
on the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder who can be out so late?&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;It might be one of the rangers only it doesn&rsquo;t sound
like their boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shut the door and thought no more of it. It
was her intention to paddle over to Stewart Island
early the next morning to aid Anne in the search
for the formula. Upon arising, she was startled to
observe a white flag flying from a high point on the
island.</p>
<p>Madge did not wait for breakfast, fearing that
something had gone wrong during the night and
that her friend might be in trouble. As she beached
her canoe at Stewart Island, Anne came running
down to meet her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything wrong?&rdquo; Madge inquired anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; Anne said impressively.</p>
<p>She led her companion to the house and they
entered the dining room. Anne went directly to a
huge walnut buffet and jerked open the drawers.
They were all empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what happened last night. All the silverware
taken!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My word!&rdquo; Madge scarcely could believe her
eyes. &ldquo;Why, I never heard of such a thing before at
Loon Lake. Was the silverware very valuable?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t afford to lose it. Still, it wasn&rsquo;t such
a costly grade of silver. I can&rsquo;t see why a thief
would go to so much risk to steal it unless he thought
he would find other valuables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else was taken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing so far as I can tell. The library was
ransacked but everything seems to be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The library! How very odd!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can&rsquo;t imagine what the thief thought he
might find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge started to say something, then closed her
lips firmly. She had a theory of her own but decided
not to mention it yet. She followed Anne
to the library. Books had been pulled from their
shelves and tumbled out upon the floor. Papers
were scattered about and the desk appeared to have
been opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t checked over all the books yet,&rdquo; Anne
said, &ldquo;though to my knowledge Father had only a
few of any real value. They&rsquo;re all here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time of night do you imagine the house
was entered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Madge, I have no idea. I must have slept
so well that I didn&rsquo;t hear a sound. Strange that I
didn&rsquo;t, for I&rsquo;m sure the thief came upstairs. The
laboratory appears to have been entered.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>Madge expressed a desire to see Mr. Fairaday&rsquo;s
workroom and was conducted upstairs. The laboratory
was in disarray. Boxes had been removed
from the shelves, containers misplaced and files
disturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if the thief were after something besides
silverware,&rdquo; she commented. &ldquo;I suppose your
Father&rsquo;s bedroom was entered too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, apparently not. My room adjoins and I am
sure I would have awakened if anyone had tried to
open the door. Perhaps the intruder knew where I
slept and avoided that part of the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge moved thoughtfully about the laboratory
examining articles which had been misplaced. In
spite of the disorder, the thief had left behind no
clue to his identity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anne, you haven&rsquo;t mentioned the formula to
anyone save Mr. Brownell, have you?&rdquo; she asked
suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no. That is, except to Clyde Wendell.
I asked him if he had any idea what could have
become of it and he said he knew nothing about it.
You don&rsquo;t think the person who came here last
night was after the formula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not. It merely occurred to me.&rdquo; Madge
lapsed into thoughtful silence. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of
anyone save Mr. Brownell who would want to lay
hands on that missing paper,&rdquo; she added, after a
moment, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m sure he never left the house last
night. But just as I was going to bed, I do recall
hearing a motor boat out on the lake and it sounded
as though it might be heading toward Stewart
Island.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jake Curtis has one, Madge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought of that right away but what reason
would he have for coming here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beyond me. All I know is that my silverware
is gone. You don&rsquo;t suppose someone&mdash;Jake
for instance, is trying to frighten me away from
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a possibility,&rdquo; Madge conceded. &ldquo;Jake
is bent on getting this property by one means or
another. Still, your theory doesn&rsquo;t entirely satisfy
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the laboratory the girls went to Mr. Fairaday&rsquo;s
bedroom. After a brief search which revealed
no clues, they examined the other upstairs rooms
and then returned to the first floor. The identity
of the prowler remained a mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t stay here alone another night,&rdquo; Madge
protested. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t care to come to the lodge,
then I think I should remain here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge did not look forward to a night at Stewart
Island. She preferred her own comfortable room
at the lodge to the gloomy, barn-like Fairaday home.
However, for the sake of her friend, she was glad
to undergo a little inconvenience. After promising
to return before nightfall, she took her leave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>Half way across the lake, she swung her canoe
toward the lookout tower. Before she could climb
the long flight of iron stairs to the platform, Jack
French came down the trail, whistling a cheerful
tune. He broke off as he saw Madge and greeted
her with a broad smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, there. Why the serious expression so
early in the morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had no breakfast for one thing. And for
another, exciting events have taken place during
the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this apple will help stave off the pangs of
hunger, you&rsquo;re welcome to it,&rdquo; he said, taking a
polished red Winesap from his jacket pocket. &ldquo;Perhaps
it will give you strength to tell me all about
the excitement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge accepted the apple gratefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;d give away the shirt off your
back, Jack,&rdquo; she smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would to you,&rdquo; he returned quietly. She
glanced up, surprised at the tone of his voice. Before
she could divine his meaning, he laughed.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s an apple, Madge? No sense getting sentimental
about one when I&rsquo;ve a case at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge felt slightly rebuffed and immediately
changed the subject to the one foremost in her mind.
Jack listened attentively as she told him all that
had befallen the previous night at Stewart Island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drop around there this morning and look
things over,&rdquo; he promised. &ldquo;Tracking down a thief
isn&rsquo;t my line exactly, but I&rsquo;ll be glad to do anything
I can to help you and Anne. This is the first
theft that&rsquo;s been reported since I came to Loon
Lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the lodge, Madge repeated the story for her
aunt&rsquo;s benefit but she took care that neither Clyde
Wendell nor Mr. Brownell were within hearing distance.
The latter had gone fishing with Old Bill
as his guide, and their boat could be seen trolling
slowly along the far shore. The chemist stationed
himself in a comfortable chair on the porch. He
appeared to be drowsing, yet whenever Madge
glanced in his direction she noticed that he was
watching the fishing boat intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems afraid he&rsquo;ll miss something,&rdquo; she
thought. &ldquo;I wonder how long he intends to remain
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chemist made no announcement of his future
plans. He seemed content to sit and dream and
think. In contrast, Mr. Brownell was a bundle of
energy. He arose at dawn to fish and did not return
until late in the evening. Several times Madge heard
him remark that he must get over to Stewart Island
to see Anne Fairaday, but each day saw him fishing
instead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>Madge and Anne welcomed the delay for although
they had searched the house many times, the
formula could not be found. Mrs. Brady had been
reluctant to have her niece spend the nights at
Stewart Island, but after several had passed with
nothing amiss, she had grown more accustomed to
the idea.</p>
<p>One evening, four days after Mr. Brownell&rsquo;s
arrival at the lodge, Madge was particularly anxious
to get supper over with so that she might start for
the island. It was nearly seven o&rsquo;clock before Mr.
Brownell and Bill came in with their string of fish.
The president was proud of four large trout he had
caught and after they were weighed, requested that
they be prepared for supper. It was well after eight
before the dishes were cleared away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do them,&rdquo; Mrs. Brady offered. &ldquo;You must
hurry along, Madge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was dark by the time she pulled up on the beach
at Stewart Island. There was no moon and the
stars were half-hidden by black clouds. Madge
could not see the house. If a lamp had been lighted,
it did not shine out through the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a spooky place after dark,&rdquo; she thought
uncomfortably. &ldquo;Wish I had my flash.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>It was difficult to find the path leading to the
house. Groping about, she stepped into a mud hole
which let her in to her shoetops. The trees along
the shore were dense and overgrown with vegetation.
At length she found a trail but before she had
followed it very far she discovered it was leading
her deeper into the brush instead of toward the
house.</p>
<p>She turned back, and impatient at the delay,
walked hurriedly, paying slight attention to the
ground underfoot. Unexpectedly, she stumbled
over a vine. She tried to save herself but went
down, striking her body against a hollow log which
lay directly ahead.</p>
<p>Madge cried out but it was more from surprise
than pain. In striking the log she distinctly had
heard from within a strange metallic sound!</p>
<p>She gave the log an exploratory kick with her
foot. Again she heard the sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something is hidden in there,&rdquo; she thought.
Stooping down, she groped about the opening at
one end of the log. It was clogged with leaves and
loose moss which she pulled away. She boldly
plunged her arm into the opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope I don&rsquo;t get it chewed off!&rdquo; she chuckled.</p>
<p>Her hand grasped something hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world?&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>Then she knew. It was Anne&rsquo;s missing silverware.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><br />CHAPTER VII
<br /><i>In a Hollow Log</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;This <i>is</i> a discovery!&rdquo; Madge assured herself as
she made successive thrusts into the old log, tumbling
out knives, forks and spoons. &ldquo;Wait until
Anne sees what I&rsquo;ve found!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Making certain that she had removed everything
from the cache, she gathered up the silverware and
hurried back to the beach. This time she made
no mistake in selecting the path and a few minutes
later saw the welcoming gleam of a light through
the trees. She rapped on the door and after a brief
wait, Anne flung it open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, here you are! I was afraid you weren&rsquo;t
coming. Why, what do you have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your silver,&rdquo; Madge laughed and thumped it
down on the table. &ldquo;See if it&rsquo;s all here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you find it?&rdquo; Anne was fairly dancing
with excitement. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad to get it
back. Tell me, did the rangers capture the thief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One question at a time,&rdquo; Madge protested. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
tell you everything while we check over the pieces.
How many were there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve of everything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>Already Madge had started to sort the forks.
Anne began on the spoons and while they counted,
she learned of the strange hiding place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gone by that log a dozen times,&rdquo; she declared,
&ldquo;but it never occurred to me to look inside.
Who could have hidden the silver there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d tell me. Why was it hidden there
at all? If the thief broke into the house to steal it
why didn&rsquo;t he take it away with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he was afraid of being caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anne, I believe that the person who entered this
house wasn&rsquo;t after the silver at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why did he take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To throw you off the track or to frighten you,&rdquo;
Madge returned impressively. &ldquo;Either someone is
after the formula or else trying to make you give
up this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks that way. I&rsquo;d suspect Jake Curtis only
it appears that if he were trying to frighten me, he
would have taken a more effective means. We
haven&rsquo;t been disturbed since you began sleeping
here nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Madge agreed. &ldquo;It may not be Jake
at all. It could be someone who is after the
formula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Brownell is the only one who wants it and
you say he is so interested in fishing he can&rsquo;t think
of anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it seems that way. Of course, there&rsquo;s
Clyde. Why do you suppose he stays around here
so long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To collect that money he claims I owe him,&rdquo;
Anne returned with an angry toss of her head.
&ldquo;He rowed over here this afternoon to tell me that
unless I paid him in a week&rsquo;s time he intended to
sue! Oh, I wonder if any girl was ever in such a
situation? Everyone after me for money and I
haven&rsquo;t a cent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle George might be able to loan you some,&rdquo;
Madge said doubtfully. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll not borrow from him when I can&rsquo;t be
sure of paying it back,&rdquo; Anne announced with decision.
&ldquo;I think the best thing to do is to tell Mr.
Brownell the truth about the formula. Then I&rsquo;ll
sell my house to Jake Curtis and try to clear up my
debts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re discouraged tonight,&rdquo; Madge said kindly,
slipping her arm about the other. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not fully
convinced the formula can&rsquo;t be found. What say
we have one grand final search tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne agreed without enthusiasm. They finished
counting the silver and accounted for all pieces
save one knife which Madge thought must have been
left in the log. Anne put everything away in its
place and locked the doors and windows for the
night. They went about it in businesslike fashion,
trying not to show that they felt the slightest uneasiness.
Nevertheless, both experienced a certain
dread of spending the night alone in the house, an
insecurity which they could not express in words.
The feeling had steadily grown upon them since the
discovery of the theft.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>Mounting the spiral stairs to the bedroom they
shared, the girls clung tightly to each other. They
hurriedly undressed and Anne blew out the oil lamp.
She made a running dive into bed, snuggling close to
Madge who gave her hand a reassuring squeeze.
Save for the moaning of the wind, the house was
quiet. Almost too quiet. In the dark the girls
could easily imagine that someone was creeping up
the stairs. Suddenly a door slammed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Madge whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been a screen door,&rdquo; Anne returned
nervously.</p>
<p>They listened intently for a minute or two but
the only sound was the brushing of a tree-branch
against the window. Gradually they relaxed and
dropped off to sleep. And the next thing they knew
it was morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up, lazy thing!&rdquo; Madge ordered, springing
from bed and taking all the covers with her. &ldquo;I
feel like a swim this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>They slipped into bathing suits and dashed down
to the beach. Madge plunged boldly into the cold
water and swam away with powerful crawl strokes.
Anne timidly waded out knee depth and stood there
shivering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, don&rsquo;t be afraid to get your ears wet!&rdquo;
Madge challenged.</p>
<p>Under her direction, Anne lost some of her timidity
but she found it difficult to entirely forget
her recent water fright. Before the swim ended she
was able to float on her back and splash about with
some resemblance to a stroke.</p>
<p>The water was too cold to encourage a long swim
but it did stimulate two healthy appetites. After
a brisk rub down, the girls did justice to a breakfast
of fried eggs, bacon, toast and wild strawberries in
thick cream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, let&rsquo;s have a look at that old log,&rdquo;
Madge proposed.</p>
<p>She led the way to the place where she had found
the silverware. The ground in the vicinity of the log
was slightly damp and Madge noticed footprints.
She bent down to examine them. Nearly all had
been made from her own small shoe, but there were
a few indistinct ones, left in the soft earth by a
man&rsquo;s tread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the missing knife!&rdquo; Anne cried jubilantly.
&ldquo;You must have dropped it on the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>Next the girls carefully investigated the inside of
the log but it was empty. They tried to follow the
footsteps leading away from the vicinity, only to
lose the trail before they had gone a quarter of the
way to the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give plenty to know who took my silver,&rdquo;
Anne remarked as they returned to the house. &ldquo;And
I&rsquo;d give even more to know if the thief really got
away with anything valuable&mdash;the formula for
instance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it. My own opinion is that it will take a
master mind to unearth it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the breakfast dishes had been disposed of,
the girls set about searching once more for the missing
paper. They looked in every out-of-the-way
cranny in the house and even poked into the attic;
they emptied old trunks and boxes of rubbish. At
last, weary and discouraged, they gave up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; Anne said miserably. &ldquo;If Father
ever wrote out that formula, it&rsquo;s gone. The next
time I see Mr. Brownell I&rsquo;ll tell him he is only wasting
his time to remain here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go fishing and forget it,&rdquo; Madge proposed
suddenly. &ldquo;If I think about formulas and silverware
and what-not much longer, I&rsquo;ll go crazy.
Let&rsquo;s go to Elf Lake on an all-day picnic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne fell in with the plan for she too was tired of
trying to solve problems which appeared to have
no solution. They agreed to meet at Black Rock
at one o&rsquo;clock since Madge must return home to
acquaint Mrs. Brady with details of the trip. On
her way back to the lodge she stopped at the lookout
to inquire of Jack if they might use his boat which
was kept at Elf Lake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he assured her heartily. &ldquo;You know
you didn&rsquo;t need to ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Promptly at one o&rsquo;clock Madge arrived at Black
Rock to find Anne already waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not need to carry the canoe across the
portage,&rdquo; she informed Anne. &ldquo;Jack left a boat
there last week when he was doing ranger work.
We&rsquo;ll only have our oars to carry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls paddled until they came to a tiny cove
which was distinguished by two large white birch
trees, marking the portage trail. There they pulled
their canoe out upon the beach and set off through
the woods, carrying oars and fishing equipment.
The portage was a long mile but the girls were
accustomed to hiking and took it at a brisk pace.</p>
<p>Soon they came within sight of Elf Lake which
glimmered brightly in the afternoon sun. At first
they could find no sign of Jack&rsquo;s boat but when
they were about to despair Madge located it under
a pile of brush near the water. They quickly
launched it and rowed to the far side of the lake,
anchoring near a stretch of lily pads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, old Mr. Bass, just sample my bait!&rdquo; Madge
coaxed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>Time and time again the girls cast into the weeds
and lily pads, using all manner of appetizing worms,
pork rind and artificial bait but for some reason,
their efforts went unrewarded. They changed locations
with no better luck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fish in this lake must all have post graduate
degrees,&rdquo; Madge complained. &ldquo;At least, they&rsquo;re
too foxy for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After several hours under the blazing sun Anne
was thoroughly discouraged but Madge would not
give up. And then as the sun was sinking low, she
was rewarded with a strike. She played her fish
deftly and landed him. Anne had no time to applaud
for a frisky bass had attached himself to her
line at the identical moment.</p>
<p>After that, the fishing was good. The girls became
so enthusiastic that they failed to notice how
rapidly the sun was sinking. Madge was the first
to observe that it was growing dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anne, we must start back this minute!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;The sun has set and it will be pitch dark
before we get through the portage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rowed hurriedly to shore and left the boat
where they had found it. Almost at a run they
started down the trail. It was far darker in the
forest than upon the lake. The path was not distinct.
Though Madge had been over it any number
of times, she knew it would be difficult to follow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s run,&rdquo; Anne suggested anxiously.</p>
<p>The oars and string of fish encumbered them
and they soon were forced to a slow walk. Before
they had gone far into the forest, darkness closed
in. Madge took the lead, and more from instinct
than sight, kept to the trail. Presently, she noticed
that the going was more difficult. Vines and old
stumps were always in the way; there seemed no
distinct opening through the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re lost!&rdquo; she thought in panic.</p>
<p>She tried to remain calm and not communicate
her fear to Anne who was blindly following her
lead. She went on for a time but presently encountered
such a tangle of bushes and vines that to
turn back was the only course. They tried to retrace
their steps. Anne was on the verge of tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be here all night,&rdquo; she murmured apprehensively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Madge insisted stubbornly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get out, only I think we&rsquo;re wasting time trying
to find the trail. If we cut straight through the
woods in the direction we&rsquo;re going we should strike
Loon Lake eventually.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne who was hopelessly confused in her directions
was ready to follow wherever her chum led.
Madge tried not to disclose that she too was uncertain.
They kept close together, walking as
swiftly as possible. Frequently, they tripped over
vines or stumps and once Anne sank nearly to her
knees in a muck hole.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go much farther,&rdquo; she half sobbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you can,&rdquo; Madge encouraged. &ldquo;I think I
see an opening through the trees. Yes, I do! It&rsquo;s
the lake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne found the strength to continue and soon
they emerged at the shore. They looked about and
saw that they were less than two hundred yards
from the portage trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all the stupidity!&rdquo; Madge exclaimed
and laughed. &ldquo;We were only a few steps from the
trail most of the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we were in an African jungle,&rdquo; Anne
sighed wearily.</p>
<p>They followed the shore until they came to their
canoe. Madge insisted upon paddling for Anne was
even more tired than she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fortunate Aunt Maude doesn&rsquo;t expect me
back home,&rdquo; she remarked as they pushed off.
&ldquo;Otherwise, she would have a searching party out
looking for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both were relieved when they came within sight
of Stewart Island for their only desire was to
tumble into bed and sleep the clock around. They
were still several hundred yards from the landing
when Madge stopped paddling and peered intently
ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Anne,&rdquo; she said in a low tone, &ldquo;unless I&rsquo;m dreaming,
I saw a light just then. Someone is at the
island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne turned to look. She too caught the flash of
a lantern moving slowly along the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be Jack French or Bill Ramey,&rdquo; she said
with an attempt at carelessness. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice carried clearly out over the water but
no answering call greeted the &ldquo;hallo.&rdquo; The light
stopped moving, as though its owner had turned
to survey the lake. Then the lantern went out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><br />CHAPTER VIII
<br /><i>A Night Caller</i></h2>
<p>It was too dark for the girls to distinguish objects
either on the water or along the shore, but a moment
after the light went out they distinctly heard
the sound of oars working in their locks. Apparently,
someone was trying to get away from the
island before their arrival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find out who it is,&rdquo; Madge said in a low
tone.</p>
<p>She snatched up the paddle again and sent the
canoe skimming through the water. Presently she
paused to listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hear a thing now, Anne. Can you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the boat must have pulled up along the
mainland somewhere. I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ve lost him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne paddled slowly along the shore, peering
toward the dense fringe of trees and underbrush.
There was no sign of a boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve probably passed it by this time,&rdquo; Madge
said at last. &ldquo;If the boat has been drawn up into
the brush we could hunt all night and never find it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>They cruised about for some minutes but finally
turned back toward Stewart Island, convinced that
they were only wasting time. Even after they
had landed there, they stood for nearly fifteen minutes
on the beach, watching for the mysterious boat
to reappear upon the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means to lie low,&rdquo; Anne declared wearily.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get something to eat. I&rsquo;m starved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if the house has been entered again?&rdquo;
Madge considered, as they started up the path carrying
their string of fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope it isn&rsquo;t turned topsy-turvy. I&rsquo;m
too tired to lift a hand tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They let themselves into the house and were relieved
to find it in its usual order. Nothing appeared
to have been disturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it was only old Bill Ramey, after all,&rdquo;
Anne suggested. &ldquo;He acts queerly sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t Bill,&rdquo; Madge insisted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of
that. It may have been that thief returning for the
silver he hid in the log.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t fit in with our theory about the
formula,&rdquo; Anne pointed out. &ldquo;We decided that
the silverware was only taken to throw us off the
track. Why then, would the thief risk coming
back for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he wouldn&rsquo;t. Oh, I give it up. Let&rsquo;s
eat!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>She cleaned several of the bass, which soon were
sizzling in a pan of butter. The girls ate heartily.
They were too tired to wash the dishes, so stacked
them neatly in the sink. When they dropped into
bed a few minutes later, they were too weary to
even consider that with a stranger prowling
about, their situation might not be too secure.
Scarcely had their heads touched the pillow than
they were asleep.</p>
<p>The girls were awake early the next morning.
Insisting that she could not remain for breakfast,
Madge started for home. Rounding the point of
the mainland not far from the lodge, her attention
was attracted to an empty boat which was drifting
close to shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that looks like one of ours,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>Drawing nearer, she saw that it was her uncle&rsquo;s
skiff. The waves were pounding it mercilessly upon
the rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s already damaged,&rdquo; she told herself
as she fastened the rope to her own boat. &ldquo;It
must not have been securely tied to the dock. I
wonder who used it last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She decided that it must have been either Clyde
Wendell or Mr. Brownell, for her aunt seldom went
out on the water and Mr. Brady was always careful.
Old Bill had been warned repeatedly to see that the
boats were firmly tied, but he was careless.</p>
<p>Mr. Brady was working along the shore when
Madge came in with the boat in tow. He met the
girl at the dock, asking where she had found it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I noticed the boat was missing this morning,&rdquo;
he added. &ldquo;I told Bill to go out and look for it, but
he&rsquo;s been killing time at something or other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brady pulled the boat out upon the sand and
turned it bottom side up. Madge watched him as
he examined the covering for stone cuts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who used it last?&rdquo; she asked curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know myself,&rdquo; her uncle returned
grimly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t rent it to any of the guests.
Either someone sneaked it out after dark last night,
or Bill used it. If I thought he was responsible, I&rsquo;d
fire him. This boat is practically ruined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve discharged poor old Bill three times already,&rdquo;
Madge reminded him impishly. &ldquo;When he
tells you his hard luck story, you always take him
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this very moment the veteran workman
slouched leisurely into view and Mr. Brady promptly
hailed him. Old Bill approached warily, knowing
from the tone of the voice, that something unpleasant
was in store. Confronted with the evidence,
he staunchly denied having used the boat
the previous night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;d go out on the lake after toting
stone all day? Not me! I tell ye, a man&rsquo;s dog tired
arfter workin&rsquo; hard from mornin&rsquo; till night. An&rsquo; if
I had a taken out the boat, you&rsquo;d heve found it tied
up ship-shape. No, sir, arfter I had me supper last
night, I went straight to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>He would have continued with a more elaborate
denial but Mr. Brady cut him short. Bill went off
looking affronted.</p>
<p>To question the guests was a delicate matter, but
Mr. Brady was bent upon getting at the bottom of
the matter. He politely brought up the subject at
the dinner table, and both the chemist and Mr.
Brownell insisted that they had not used the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone is telling a whopper,&rdquo; Madge thought.
&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if the person who took
that boat used it to visit Stewart Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the question had been put to him in a
casual way, Clyde adopted the attitude that he was
under suspicion. He sulked about the house the
early part of the afternoon, scarcely addressing a
pleasant word to anyone. Then, evidently upon
sudden impulse, he rented the canoe and set out for
Stewart Island.</p>
<p>Mr. Brownell who had been loafing about the
lodge the better part of the morning, did not see
him leave, but a few minutes later, he too expressed
a desire to go out upon the lake. Madge explained
that with the skiff damaged, the canoe in use, and
Bill hauling stone in the boat, it would be impossible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must get over to Stewart Island,&rdquo; he protested.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve put it off too long now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Unless you care to swim I&rsquo;m afraid you must
wait until Bill or Clyde return,&rdquo; Madge returned.</p>
<p>She did not wish to help Mr. Brownell reach
Stewart Island, knowing that Anne was not ready
for his visit, but she had been truthful in saying that
there was no way for him to make the trip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anne will have trouble enough with Clyde,&rdquo; she
thought. &ldquo;I imagine he&rsquo;s bothering her about
money again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brownell wandered restlessly up and down
the beach, watching the lake for a glimpse of the
canoe or Old Bill. After a time he sat down on the
veranda to read and Madge who had finished her
work, brought out the books Anne had loaned her.
Until now she had not had an opportunity to look
them over. Propping herself in the porch swing,
she settled down for an hour of pleasant reading.</p>
<p>She picked up the first volume and her face
underwent a distinct change as she read the title of
the Kipling book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Kim,&rsquo;&rdquo; she repeated to herself. &ldquo;Strange I never
thought of the connection before this! I&rsquo;m sure
Anne said Kim was the last word her father spoke
before his death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She continued to stare at the little volume in her
hand. The word seemed to burn deeply into her
mind. It must have significance. She recalled
Anne had told her the Kipling book was her father&rsquo;s
favorite. Could there be a connection between the
hidden formula and the book?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Anne probably never dreamed of such a thing or
she wouldn&rsquo;t have loaned the volume to me,&rdquo; Madge
reasoned. &ldquo;It may be only another wild idea of
mine and yet it&rsquo;s barely possible I&rsquo;ve stumbled upon
a clue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She held the book up and shook it but nothing
fell to the ground. Slightly disappointed, she began
a systematic search, turning the pages one by
one. She failed to find a paper of any description
and there was not the slightest trace of writing on
the margins or fly leaves.</p>
<p>Madge decided that she had made a mistake and
tossed the book impatiently aside. Her interest in
reading had vanished. She gazed meditatively out
across the lake. Then her face brightened and she
snatched up the Kipling book again.</p>
<p>Why hadn&rsquo;t she thought of it before? When Mr.
Fairaday had attempted to tell Anne where the
formula was hidden he had broken off with the
words: &ldquo;Written in secret&mdash;&rdquo; and kept repeating
&ldquo;Kim.&rdquo; Perhaps he had tried to say: &ldquo;Written
in secret <i>ink</i>.&rdquo; Wasn&rsquo;t it possible that he had endeavored
to convey the idea that the important
message was written on one of the fly leaves or the
page margins of &ldquo;Kim&rdquo;?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>Overcome with enthusiasm for what she considered
a most brilliant deduction, Madge broke
forth in a little war whoop. She stopped short as
she heard someone laugh. She had entirely forgotten
Mr. Brownell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; he remarked dryly, &ldquo;that book
must be interesting to affect you like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Madge could prevent it, he moved over
to the swing and curiously picked up the book she
had been reading. Her face was the hue of a ripe
tomato.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll just take this along with me,&rdquo; he said
teasingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; Madge exclaimed and then added
hastily: &ldquo;You see, it&rsquo;s a borrowed book. I&mdash;I&rsquo;m not
through with it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brownell laughed but he continued to study
the book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re through with it, I&rsquo;d like to have
it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always wanted to read &lsquo;Kim&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he dropped the book into Madge&rsquo;s lap
and vanished into the lodge. Scarcely had the door
closed behind him that she snatched up the little
volume and bore it triumphantly to her bedroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Mr. Brownell,&rdquo; she chuckled, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ll
never get this book. Tonight I mean to take it with
me to the island. And here&rsquo;s hoping that when the
pages are heated, the secret will be revealed!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><br />CHAPTER IX
<br /><i>A Significant Title</i></h2>
<p>Madge was impatient to tell Anne her new theory
regarding the missing formula but it was not easy
to get away early that evening. Bill did not return
with his load of stone until nearly dark, and Clyde
Wendell, who had a habit of being late for meals,
failed to appear until supper was nearly finished.
Then he lingered over his coffee long after the
others had gone outside. When he finally joined
them on the veranda, Madge snatched the dishes
from the table and had them in and out of the pan
in a twinkling.</p>
<p>It was growing dark as she flew to her room for
the things she meant to take with her to the island.
She wrapped up a small bundle and tucked &ldquo;Kim&rdquo;
under her arm.</p>
<p>Mr. Brownell and the chemist were arguing about
something but they broke off as she crossed the
veranda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That book must have a fascination,&rdquo; the former
remarked jokingly. &ldquo;Do you sleep with it under
your pillow, Miss Sterling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What book?&rdquo; Clyde asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>She pretended not to hear but Mr. Brownell
supplied the title.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Kim,&rsquo;&rdquo; the chemist repeated. &ldquo;Did I understand
you correctly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge did not care to be drawn into the conversation
nor did she wish to answer questions about
the book. Without waiting for Mr. Brownell&rsquo;s
reply, she hastily made her way down to the lake.</p>
<p>Anne was waiting for her when she reached the
island and immediately plunged into an account of
Clyde&rsquo;s afternoon visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He made a dreadful scene, Madge. He said he&rsquo;d
give me just two days and if I don&rsquo;t turn over
five hundred dollars by that time, he&rsquo;ll bring
court action. I&rsquo;m so worried I don&rsquo;t know what
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do nothing,&rdquo; Madge advised. &ldquo;He knows he
can&rsquo;t get anywhere if it comes to a legal fight. He&rsquo;s
only trying to bluff you, Anne. Sometimes, I think
it wasn&rsquo;t the money that brought him here at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I. All the time he was talking with me
this afternoon, he kept looking around and sort of
studying things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he seem particularly interested in the library?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he asked me if I had considered selling
my books as a means of raising money. I told him
I didn&rsquo;t think they would bring much.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t ask you about that Kipling book you
loaned me, did he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne shook her head. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge lost no time in explaining her theory of
the connection between the title and the words Mr.
Fairaday had spoken at the time of his death. She
half expected Anne to laugh at the idea, but instead,
she became excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madge, you&rsquo;re nothing less than a genius! Why
didn&rsquo;t I think of that myself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a hunch. I may be wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything fits in beautifully. &lsquo;Kim&rsquo; was
Father&rsquo;s favorite book. And another thing, he was
always interested in codes, secret inks and the like.
During the war he worked for the government, deciphering
messages which were thought to have
been composed by spies. He was especially interested
in secret inks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we may be on the right track,&rdquo; Madge
declared enthusiastically. &ldquo;The only way we can
tell is to try to bring out the secret writing, if there
is any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy to do. Let&rsquo;s go to the laboratory
right now and see what we can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With high spirits they raced up the stairs to Mr.
Fairaday&rsquo;s workroom. Anne brought out an alcohol
lamp which she lighted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the first thing about heating the
pages,&rdquo; Madge confessed. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid we&rsquo;ll
burn them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne shook her head. She had aided her father
with any number of minor experiments and knew
how to handle laboratory apparatus. However, she
was so excited and hopeful that her hand trembled
as she held the first fly leaf above the flame. She
moved it slowly back and forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing seems to be coming up,&rdquo; Madge observed
in disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re only starting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne worked patiently, heating the blank pages
and the front and back of the book. When the
final sheet did not reveal the secret, her confidence
fell. Madge suggested that they try the margins
and they took turns warming the printed pages. At
length Anne passed the last sheet over the lamp.
They watched with bated breath. Nothing came
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Madge, I&rsquo;m so disappointed I could cry,&rdquo;
she wailed, sinking down into a chair. &ldquo;I was so
sure we were right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So was I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This book was absolutely our last hope. If Mr.
Brownell comes here tomorrow I must tell him the
truth. I&rsquo;ve kept him waiting so long he&rsquo;ll be justified
in feeling I&rsquo;ve tricked him. Oh, dear! Why
did I get into such a position?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t your fault.&rdquo; Madge relapsed into
thoughtful silence. At length she said: &ldquo;I think
Clyde is trying to sell Mr. Brownell a formula of his
own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;ll succeed where I have failed. His
formula may not be half as good as Father&rsquo;s, yet if
Mr. Brownell learns there is no hope of getting it
he may deal with Clyde.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge acknowledged the truth of this. She had
hoped matters might work out to Anne&rsquo;s advantage
but luck had never been with her. To admit defeat
seemed the only course.</p>
<p>It was nearly midnight and the girls were tired as
well as discouraged. They put aside the apparatus
and went to their bedroom, leaving the book lying
on the laboratory table. Few words were spoken as
they prepared for bed. Anne blew out the light and
soon was asleep.</p>
<p>Madge rolled and tossed and remained wide
awake. Try as she would, she could not take her
mind from the perplexing problem of the formula.
She had no real hope of working out a solution yet
she kept turning the matter over and over in her
mind. Then like a flash, the answer came!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anne! Anne!&rdquo; she cried jubilantly, shaking her
chum rudely by the shoulder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of it at
last!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><br />CHAPTER X
<br /><i>An Unsatisfactory Test</i></h2>
<p>Anne rolled over in bed and groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; she murmured drowsily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up, sleepy head,&rdquo; Madge said, shaking her
again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had another inspiration about the formula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the word &ldquo;formula&rdquo; which was magic to her
ears, Anne sat upright, ready to listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been hopeless duds trying to bring out
the secret writing by heating the pages of the
book!&rdquo; Madge declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you awakened me to tell me that? Of all
the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not through. Remember, you said your
Father knew a great deal about secret inks and the
like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a government specialist,&rdquo; Anne corrected;
&ldquo;He probably knew as much about secret
inks as any man in Washington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge nodded eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. And here we&rsquo;ve been working on the
theory that he would use the most simple means of
hidden writing. Why, you can write with milk and
bring it out by heating the paper. Any school child
knows that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Father always had an aversion to the obvious
thing too,&rdquo; Anne declared, catching her friend&rsquo;s
trend of thought. &ldquo;He probably used the very latest
method of secret writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the conclusion I reached,&rdquo; Madge announced
eagerly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to wager that the
formula is written in &lsquo;Kim&rsquo; if only we can find the
right method of bringing it out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know the way,&rdquo; Anne returned.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t find that sort of information in books
either&mdash;that is, not the latest processes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know anyone who might help us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clyde Wendell, if he would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s count him out. He wouldn&rsquo;t help a blind
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I fear&mdash;oh, wait! I just thought of a man
who worked with Father in the Washington bureau.
He knows everything about codes and ciphers and
secret inks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you reach him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I could write to Washington. I believe he&rsquo;s
still with the government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would take ages,&rdquo; Madge protested. &ldquo;We
must have quick action or Mr. Brownell will leave.
Why not telegraph?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can,&rdquo; Anne agreed instantly. &ldquo;Why, where are
you going?&rdquo; she demanded as Madge slid out of bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back to the laboratory after &lsquo;Kim.&rsquo; It
would be just our luck to have it stolen during the
night. No use taking chances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne would not permit her to go alone so together
they stole down the dark hallway. The floor
creaked beneath their feet and the light from the
lamp made weird shadows dance on the plaster
walls.</p>
<p>To their relief they found the book where they
had left it. For the remainder of the night they
slept with it under Anne&rsquo;s pillow.</p>
<p>At the first sign of dawn they arose and dressed.
They planned to go to Luxlow as soon after breakfast
as they could find means of transportation and
the question arose as to what should be done with
the book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to leave it here while we&rsquo;re gone,&rdquo;
Anne said. &ldquo;The house has been entered once and
we saw a prowler around at night. Why don&rsquo;t you
take it back to the lodge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d prefer not to have the responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do keep it, Madge. I&rsquo;ll not have a comfortable
moment if we leave it here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>Unwillingly, Madge allowed herself to be persuaded.
Shortly after eight o&rsquo;clock, they locked the
house and crossed the lake to the Brady lodge.
Neither Mr. Brownell nor Clyde Wendell were
abroad for they were late risers. The girls went to
Madge&rsquo;s room for her coat and hat and while there
decided that for the time being &ldquo;Kim&rdquo; would be
safe in the lower bureau drawer. They covered the
book with a layer of clothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one ever comes in here save Aunt Maude
and she wouldn&rsquo;t think of disturbing anything,&rdquo;
Madge said.</p>
<p>How to get to Luxlow was the next problem for
Mr. Brady had taken the car away early that morning.
However, learning that one of the rangers was
driving in, they received permission to ride with
him. Madge rather wished that Jack might have
been the one to take them but he was busy surveying
a new road which the government intended to
put through the forest.</p>
<p>Enroute to town the girls busied themselves with
the telegram they intended to dispatch to the man
in Washington. Anne had found his address on an
old envelope in her father&rsquo;s files. It was not easy
to explain what they wanted to know in a few
words without sounding utterly ridiculous. After
several trials, the message finally suited them.
Arriving at Luxlow, they sent it off and purchased
supplies which Mrs. Brady had requested. The last
item on the list she had given Madge, read: &ldquo;magazines
for Bill.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He always wants the cheapest kind,&rdquo; she told
Anne. &ldquo;I have a notion to take him a few high-brow
ones for a change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never forgive you if you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sought a street stand which displayed magazines
of all type. With considerable embarrassment
they selected a half dozen of the melodramatic sort
and Madge actually blushed as she paid the salesgirl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next time, Bill buys his own trash or he
goes without!&rdquo; she fumed. &ldquo;Did you see the pitying
look that girl gave us? She thought we wanted
them for ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked slowly down the street, Madge
carrying the magazines so that the jackets would
not be noticed by the passersby. They were within
sight of the ranger&rsquo;s parked automobile when Anne
heard her name called. She turned and saw Jake
Curtis.</p>
<p>It was too late to retreat. They could only wait
and face the music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went out to Stewart Island last week to see
you, Miss Fairaday,&rdquo; the man began in an unpleasant
tone. &ldquo;You were gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must have been at the Brady lodge,&rdquo; Anne replied
uneasily. &ldquo;Or perhaps it was the day we went
fishing. If I had known you were coming&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have been away just the same!&rdquo; the man
finished harshly. &ldquo;Well, I warn you it will do you
no good to try to avoid me. I mean business. The
mortgage must be paid by the first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t the first,&rdquo; Anne reminded him. &ldquo;I
have several days yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to sell the house, you haven&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll give you
just twenty-four hours to decide what you want to
do. I&rsquo;ll wipe off the mortgage and give you five
hundred dollars for the house and island. But the
offer only holds until tomorrow noon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s robbery!&rdquo; Anne protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it or leave it,&rdquo; he retorted, and turning,
walked away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><br />CHAPTER XI
<br /><i>The Secret Hiding Place</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;My! My! Is Jake Curtis important?&rdquo; Madge
mocked. &ldquo;Take it or leave it! I wish you had told
him to jump in the lake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear I&rsquo;m at his mercy,&rdquo; Anne returned in a
disheartened tone. &ldquo;What can I do in twenty-four
hours? I can&rsquo;t borrow enough money to pay off the
mortgage. And if I sold the house and island at
public auction it probably wouldn&rsquo;t bring enough
to get me out of debt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jake would see to that,&rdquo; Madge said feelingly.
&ldquo;He has underhanded ways of managing things.
But don&rsquo;t take it so hard, Anne. We&rsquo;ll find some
way to best him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The formula was my only chance of raising
money and we couldn&rsquo;t possibly unearth it in
twenty-four hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man in Washington may wire right back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And again, he may never answer,&rdquo; Anne added
gloomily. &ldquo;Oh, well, it does no good to moan. Let&rsquo;s
go back to the car.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>The girls reached the Brady lodge in time for a
late luncheon. Learning that Mr. Brownell had gone
fishing again and that Clyde Wendell had not been
seen since breakfast, Madge persuaded Anne to
remain for a few hours.</p>
<p>They had lunch and then sat on the veranda. As
usual the conversation turned to the missing formula
and to the book which they hoped would disclose
the secret. Madge brought it from the house
and they looked at it again. While they were pouring
over the pages, Mrs. Brady came outside to
suggest that Madge take the newly purchased magazines
to Bill&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s laid up with rheumatism again today,&rdquo; she
explained, &ldquo;and I know he&rsquo;ll appreciate something
to read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rheumatism, like fun!&rdquo; Madge laughed as she
arose to do her aunt&rsquo;s bidding. &ldquo;I notice his attacks
always come on the days when Uncle George has
planned a hard day&rsquo;s work. You&rsquo;re both too easy on
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She accepted the magazines, and with Anne, who
still had the book in her hand, walked a short distance
through the woods to Bill&rsquo;s cabin. From afar
they glimpsed the old workman smoking his pipe on
the porch but he quickly vanished inside as he saw
them coming. When they knocked, a muffled voice
bade them enter.</p>
<p>They entered the room to see Bill stretched on his
bunk, his face twisted with pain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thet you, Miss Madge?&rdquo; he mumbled, making
an exaggerated effort to lift himself to a sitting
position. &ldquo;If Mr. Brady sent you to find out how I
be, you kin tell him I ain&rsquo;t no better. My back&rsquo;s
nigh to killin&rsquo; me. I didn&rsquo;t git a wink o&rsquo; sleep last
night and this mornin&rsquo; seems like me poor old
body&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; Madge interrupted. &ldquo;Uncle
George didn&rsquo;t send me. I brought these magazines
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill&rsquo;s face brightened. He swung his feet to the
floor with alacrity, then remembering his ailment,
groaned and told Madge to leave the magazines on
the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be doin&rsquo; much readin&rsquo; fer several days
yet,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll jes&rsquo; lie here quiet like and
try to git me strength back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls soon left, but mischievously hid themselves
behind a tree only a short ways from the
cabin. Before long, Old Bill&rsquo;s tousled head was
thrust cautiously out the door. Seeing that the
coast was clear he took up his seat in the sun and
soon was lost in the depth of a bloodcurdling detective
story. The girls stole quietly away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always that way,&rdquo; Madge declared. &ldquo;For
every honest day of labor he does, Bill rests six! I
guess at that we couldn&rsquo;t get along without him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>Taking a different trail through the woods, the
girls presently came to a newly constructed two-room
log cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle George plans to rent it out later in the
summer,&rdquo; Madge explained. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all finished now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it nice inside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lovely. I&rsquo;ll open it up and show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge dashed off through the woods, returned in
a few minutes with the key, which after a few unsuccessful
turns, unlocked the cabin door. The
rooms had been furnished with rustic furniture
that Mr. Brady had made himself. The unpainted
log walls gave off a pleasant, fresh odor. Madge
pointed out the huge stone fireplace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill will be proud of this until his dying day.
He can tell you the number of stones in it too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you ever keep him at it long enough
to get it done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a problem. Uncle George supervised the
work, of course. Even then, Bill made several mistakes
in placing the stones. See&mdash;&rdquo; she indicated a
deep ledge, well-hidden up the chimney. &ldquo;No one
knows why he did that. The chimney may not
draw right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madge, how long before this cabin will be
used?&rdquo; Anne asked suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not for a month or so. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking&mdash;this ledge is made to order!&rdquo;
Anne glanced at the book she still carried in her
hand. &ldquo;We must hide &lsquo;Kim&rsquo; somewhere. Why
wouldn&rsquo;t this shelf be an ideal place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it would. No one ever comes here now
the cabin is finished. The key is kept in the kitchen
cupboard and the windows are always locked from
the inside. The only danger might be that someone
would start a fire to test the chimney. And if
Uncle George should decide to do that, I could
rescue the book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hide it here then, Madge. Somehow, I don&rsquo;t
feel that it is very safe in your bureau drawer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I, with so many guests around. But
I&rsquo;m not convinced this is such a safe place either.
I&rsquo;d feel better if you took the book back home with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;d much rather you kept it. And we can&rsquo;t
ask for a better place than this shelf. Who would
think of looking here? It&rsquo;s well hidden and the book
just fits the space.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne thrust an exploratory hand up the
chimney. As she observed, the ledge seemed to have
been built for &ldquo;Kim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we may as well leave it there,&rdquo; Madge
said, a trifle reluctantly. &ldquo;At any rate, the book
will be safer than in my bureau drawer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left the cabin, locking the door behind
them. Madge cast an uneasy glance about the clearing.
&ldquo;You&mdash;you didn&rsquo;t hear anything?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hear anything? Why, no. What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge did not reply immediately for her sharp
eyes were searching the line of trees which circled
about the little cabin. Gradually, the tense lines of
her face relaxed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as we came out, I thought I saw someone&mdash;right
close to the cabin. For a minute, I was sure I
heard a stick crackle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imagination!&rdquo; Anne laughed. &ldquo;The responsibility
of keeping the book is making you nervous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so. Still, this hiding place doesn&rsquo;t entirely
suit me. Let&rsquo;s go back and get it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; Anne protested. &ldquo;The place is all
right. No use treating that book as though it were
a bag of gold. Come along. I must be getting on
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reluctantly, Madge permitted herself to be led
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she gave in, &ldquo;but if anything happens,
don&rsquo;t blame me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><br />CHAPTER XII
<br /><i>The Awaited Message</i></h2>
<p>For the first time in many nights Madge slept
at home. Although she would not have admitted
it, &ldquo;Kim&rdquo; was responsible for her reluctance to
return with Anne to Stewart Island. She did not
retire until after the guests had gone to their rooms,
and then tossed restlessly. Finally she dozed off,
only to be awakened by an unusual sound.</p>
<p>She sat up in bed. The house was quiet but she
was sure she had heard someone stumble over a
chair in the kitchen. Ordinarily, she would have
gone back to sleep. Instead, she thought of the key
in the cupboard. What if it were stolen?</p>
<p>Slipping into a dressing gown, she stole quietly
downstairs. On the bottom step she paused and
listened. She heard someone moving about. Then
distinctly, but very softly, a door closed.</p>
<p>Now thoroughly alarmed, Madge hurried to the
kitchen. Groping about, she found a lamp and
lighted it. To her relief, the key still hung on its
hook in the cupboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My imagination is getting the best of me!&rdquo; she
chuckled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have sworn someone was down here.
I more than half expected the key to be gone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>She returned to her bedroom, taking the key
with her. Placing it carefully under her pillow she
jumped into bed and soon was fast asleep.</p>
<p>In the morning her fears seemed ridiculous, so
when she made her bed, she returned the key to
its old place in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Directly after breakfast, Mr. Brady left the
lodge, saying that he must examine some timber
land and would not return until nightfall. Mrs.
Brady was confined to her room with a headache
and Mr. Brownell had taken one of the boats and
rowed away toward Stewart Island. That left only
Clyde who loitered about the kitchen while Madge
fried doughnuts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a bad cook,&rdquo; he complimented, helping
himself to a crisp, brown fried cake. &ldquo;This one
tastes a little soggy though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d think it would after you&rsquo;ve eaten six,&rdquo;
Madge observed.</p>
<p>She was glad when he finally left the kitchen.
Dipping the last doughnut in sugar, she too slipped
outside and was just in time to sight Jack French
paddling toward the beach in his canoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Jack,&rdquo; she greeted, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you
in days.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the government didn&rsquo;t plant us in the
forest for ornaments, you know,&rdquo; he replied cheerfully.
&ldquo;I just returned from Luxlow where they
gave me a message for Anne. Since you two stick
together like burrs I thought I might find her here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen her today,&rdquo; Madge returned, an
eager note creeping into her voice. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a wire
from Washington?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say, but it is a telegram. It may be important
so I&rsquo;ll be paddling along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going over to the island before long. If you
like, I can take the message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you want to find out what it&rsquo;s all
about,&rdquo; he teased, handing over the yellow envelope.
&ldquo;Oh, well, I&rsquo;ll be glad to be saved the trip. On your
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge lost no time in going to the island. She
marched into the kitchen where Anne was working,
waving the telegram triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not an answer to our wire?&rdquo; Anne demanded
hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be. Open it quick before my nervous
system explodes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne&rsquo;s hand shook so that it was difficult for
her to rip open the envelope. Her face was a study
as she scanned the message. Then she fairly glowed
with pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is from that Washington man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does he say?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to this! He thinks the formula may have
been written on the blank pages of the book with
just ordinary water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge stared incredulously. &ldquo;Water?&rdquo; she
echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I recall now that Father once mentioned
the same. Strange it slipped my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard of writing with water. It doesn&rsquo;t
seem possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe the method was discovered during the
late war,&rdquo; Anne explained. &ldquo;Anyway, a secret message
can be written on certain types of paper merely
by using a clean pen and water. The water disturbs
the fibers of the paper&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t visible to the eye,
of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how could the writing be brought out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all explained here,&rdquo; Anne said, offering the
telegram. &ldquo;You insert the paper in a glass case and
shoot in a thin iodine vapor which settles into all
tissues disturbed by the pen. He&rsquo;s sending complete
instructions by mail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds dreadfully complicated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to me. I&rsquo;ve helped Father with other experiments
and I know how to go about this. Let&rsquo;s get
the book now and see if we can bring out the secret
writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t we wait for complete instructions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t wait! So much depends on getting
the formula within the next few hours. We&rsquo;ll not
ruin the book. I&rsquo;m sure I know just how to go about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>Madge gave in and they made a quick trip to the
Brady lodge which seemed strangely quiet and deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Maude must be sleeping,&rdquo; Madge observed.
&ldquo;Clyde was here when I left but he appears
to have taken himself off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They let themselves into the kitchen. Madge went
directly to the cupboard for the key to the new
cabin. It was not on its usual peg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me it&rsquo;s lost,&rdquo; Anne said nervously.</p>
<p>Madge did not answer immediately. Then her
face relaxed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it dropped into this cup. Gave me a scare
for a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In relief, they hurried to the newly built cabin.
Madge unlocked the door and they entered. Everything
appeared exactly as they had last seen it.</p>
<p>Madge went confidently to the fireplace and ran
her hand up to the hidden ledge. A startled expression
passed over her face. She groped about the
ledge a second time, more carefully than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Anne asked, though she
read the answer in her friend&rsquo;s tense face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; Madge answered. &ldquo;Someone has
stolen our book!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><br />CHAPTER XIII
<br /><i>The Missing Book</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Gone,&rdquo; Anne echoed blankly. &ldquo;Oh, it must be
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Madge insisted. &ldquo;Oh, I knew something
would happen to it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge stepped back to permit Anne to take her
place at the chimney. Both were trying desperately
to remain calm, attempting to make themselves believe
the book had only been misplaced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, it&rsquo;s not here,&rdquo; Anne murmured,
after feeling carefully along the ledge. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
suppose either your aunt or uncle could have put
it away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge shook her head doubtfully. A conviction
that the book had been deliberately stolen was growing
in her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can soon find out,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>They rushed back to the house. Mrs. Brady had
finished her nap and was sewing. The girls found
her in the living room and incoherently poured out
their story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t get excited,&rdquo; she advised kindly.
&ldquo;The book will turn up. Mr. Brady hasn&rsquo;t been near
the cabin, but one can&rsquo;t be sure about Bill. He&rsquo;s into
everything. Why not question him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frantic with anxiety, they hurried to the old
workman&rsquo;s cabin. He denied taking the key.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would I be doin&rsquo; with it anyhow?&rdquo; he
demanded crossly. &ldquo;After buildin&rsquo; that fireplace
and luggin&rsquo; all that heavy stone, I&rsquo;d be right well
pleased if I never saw the place agin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then who did take the key?&rdquo; Madge fairly
wailed. &ldquo;Someone used it and put it back in the
wrong place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill shrugged and would have retreated into the
cabin had not Madge halted him with an abrupt
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen anyone prowling about the new
cabin or acting suspiciously? I know you&rsquo;re something
of a detective. Perhaps you noticed Clyde
Wendell or one of the guests acting strangely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill could not resist this direct appeal to his vanity.
He assumed an important pose and his brows
came together in a thoughtful pucker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t aimin&rsquo; to mention it,&rdquo; he informed
regally, &ldquo;&rsquo;cause Mr. Brady&rsquo;s warned me mor&rsquo;n once
not to talk about the guests&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is different,&rdquo; Madge urged impatiently.
&ldquo;Tell us everything. It&rsquo;s very important and time
means everything!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>Bill&rsquo;s blue eyes opened wider. Here was something
which smacked of mystery. He decided to make the
most of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I been watchin&rsquo; that guy Wendell fer a long
time,&rdquo; he reported. &ldquo;My suspicions was aroused
when he kept trying&rsquo; to pump me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of questions did he ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most everything. About the fishin&rsquo; and the like.
He asked about whether Miss Fairaday stayed alone
nights and if she&rsquo;d sold any of her books and things.
He&rsquo;d pester me when I was tryin&rsquo; to work on the
new fireplace. Come to think of it, he even asked
me where the key to the cabin was kept!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill had intended to tell a good story. He was surprised
to find that by cudgeling his memory he had
no need to call upon imagination to furnish interesting
details.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did Clyde ask about the key?&rdquo; Madge
questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lemme see,&rdquo; Bill scratched his head thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Las&rsquo; night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was all clear to Madge now. The book had
been hidden only the previous afternoon. She had
sensed then that someone was hiding in the bushes
near the cabin. Undoubtedly, Clyde Wendell had
witnessed everything.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Anne, Clyde was after your book from the very
first!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Probably his own formula is
worthless, and he hoped to get possession of your
Father&rsquo;s work and claim it as his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if he saw us hide the book, why didn&rsquo;t he
take it last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he did try. I heard someone in the
kitchen during the night. When I went down to
get the key, he must have heard me coming and
ducked into his bedroom which is on the first floor.
Oh, if only I&rsquo;d kept that key instead of returning
it to the cupboard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was all my fault. I chose the hiding place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clyde won&rsquo;t get away. We&rsquo;ll make him give the
book back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Bill had been listening attentively to the conversation
which he only partially understood. Now
he decided it was time to add his startling contribution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;ll have to ketch him first. He checked
out mor&rsquo;n an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Checked out?&rdquo; Madge asked sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He cleaned out bag and baggage while you was
over to the island. I offered to row him across the
lake but he said he&rsquo;d do it himself. Guess he was
afraid he&rsquo;d have to give me a quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way did he go, Bill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said a car was to meet him across the lake
and take him on to Luxlow. I would have watched
only I was snowed under with work.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We must go after him! Bill, get over to the lookout
as fast as you can and ask one of the rangers to
come here. Get Jack if he&rsquo;s there. Tell him it&rsquo;s
urgent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill moved away with alacrity and the girls flew
to the house to acquaint Mrs. Brady with the startling
news. As Madge had guessed, she knew nothing
of the chemist&rsquo;s departure. A survey of his room
disclosed that he had taken all his luggage. He had
gone without paying his bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only your uncle were here!&rdquo; Mrs. Brady expressed
indignantly. &ldquo;And where is Mr. Brownell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw him this morning, didn&rsquo;t you, Anne?&rdquo;
Madge asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; the other returned in surprise. &ldquo;He
never came to the island unless it was after I left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men are always gone when you need them!&rdquo;
Mrs. Brady exclaimed impatiently. &ldquo;The best we
can do is to telephone to Luxlow and try to have
someone stop Clyde there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rushed away to the telephone and just then
the girls saw a boat rounding the point of the mainland.
Mr. Brownell drew up to the wharf. His face
brightened as he saw Anne, but realizing that something
was amiss, he made no attempt to engage her
in conversation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>A few minutes later Bill returned with Jack
French in the latter&rsquo;s canoe. The ranger had gleaned
most of the facts from the old workman. He asked
Madge and Anne only a few, terse questions. Mr.
Brownell listened intently to the excited discussion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Wendell got away with the formula?&rdquo; he
broke in. &ldquo;I knew there was something queer about
the whole deal but I couldn&rsquo;t figure it out. Ranger,
I&rsquo;ll pay you well if you bring him back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do what I can,&rdquo; Jack told him quietly, &ldquo;and
pay doesn&rsquo;t enter into it. We&rsquo;re not sure which way
he went.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if he did say he was going to Luxlow, I&rsquo;d
guess he headed for Bryson,&rdquo; Madge interposed. &ldquo;If
he reached there by afternoon he could get a train
out for New York. His Luxlow connections would
be very poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was askin&rsquo; me about the Elf Lake portage
only yesterday,&rdquo; Bill volunteered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if he did go the other way, we&rsquo;ll lose him,&rdquo;
Anne said anxiously, as the ranger moved toward
his canoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m striking for Elf Lake,&rdquo; Jack said crisply.
&ldquo;Mr. Brownell, you go to Luxlow and try to head
Clyde off there. Bill can drive you in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The plan was instantly adopted. Jack sprang into
his canoe but Madge was directly behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go too! You can make faster time with
two paddling.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>Jack hesitated briefly, then nodded. Madge slid
into the bow and caught up a paddle. Anne gave
the canoe a shove, wading far out into the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope you catch him!&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;Paddle
for all you&rsquo;re worth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack and Madge cut directly across the lake,
taking a course straight as a die. Madge realized
that to overtake the chemist they must travel at
double his speed. She had a muscular arm and made
each stroke count. Several times the ranger warned
her to take it easier.</p>
<p>They passed Black Rock, coming at last to the
first portage marked by the birches. Abandoning
the canoe they started unencumbered through the
forest, for Jack knew where a Forest Service canoe
had been hidden at Elf Lake. Twice he paused to
examine the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came this way all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emerging from among the trees at Elf Lake, they
scanned the water. There was no sign of a boat or
canoe. Jack frowned. Apparently, the chemist had
traveled fast.</p>
<p>A moment later, the frown changed to a distinct
scowl as he searched the bushes in vain for the hidden
government canoe. Almost at once he noted
the long marks on the sand, disclosing where it had
been dragged to the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clyde&rsquo;s made off with our canoe! Now we are
in it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>Madge&rsquo;s eye fastened upon an unpainted rowboat
abandoned upon the sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a regular tub and probably leaks like a
sieve,&rdquo; she announced, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s our only hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found the oars and quickly launched the
boat. All of Madge&rsquo;s dire predictions were found
true. She bailed steadily to keep the boat afloat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re losing time,&rdquo; Jack said gruffly. &ldquo;Wendell
has a fast canoe now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s a dub at paddling,&rdquo; Madge added hopefully.
&ldquo;We have a chance of overtaking him at the
Rice Lake portage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a short one and we&rsquo;re a good ways behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prospect of portaging the boat was discouraging.
They both knew that unless they overtook
the chemist by the time he reached Rice Lake, they
likely would lose him. Once he had covered the
second portage, a short paddle would take him to
Bryson, a city of sufficient population to offer protection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; Jack said as they grounded the boat
at the extreme end of Elf Lake. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never overtake
him if we try to tote this old tub. I know a
shortcut through the forest but it&rsquo;s hard going even
without dunnage. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge hesitated. She realized that if they left
the boat behind, they must overtake Clyde at the
end of the portage or lose him entirely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long chance,&rdquo; Jack said, reading her
thoughts, &ldquo;and the trail is too hard for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge shook her head stubbornly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she returned with firm decision. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
manage to keep up. We&rsquo;ll leave the boat behind and
try the shortcut!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><br />CHAPTER XIV
<br /><i>The Shortcut</i></h2>
<p>Jack led Madge a short distance down the shore.
After surveying the locality intently to be certain
of his bearings, the ranger parted the thick growth
of bush which fringed the water, and they plunged
into the forest. At first they followed a thinly worn
path, but presently thorny vines and underbrush
impeded their progress. It was unpleasantly warm;
mosquitoes and insects were a torment.</p>
<p>Once Jack slackened his pace and looked back
at his companion but Madge urged him on. She
knew that everything depended upon speed. Rather
than hold Jack back she would drop by the wayside.</p>
<p>She managed to keep up with him, never uttering
a word of complaint, but when at last they
came within sight of Rice Lake she felt that she
could not have continued a hundred yards farther.
Emerging from the forest they paused to survey
the lake. There was no sign of a canoe or a boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;re too late?&rdquo; Madge asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard to tell,&rdquo; Jack returned briefly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>They hurriedly made their way along the muddy
shore toward the point which marked the end of
the portage Clyde Wendell must have taken. Jack
studied the soft ground along the shore but the
only footsteps visible had been made many days before.
They walked a few steps down the portage
and paused to listen. Only the wild cry of a bird
greeted their ears. No broken twigs or bushes disclosed
that anyone had passed along the trail that
day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either we&rsquo;re here ahead of him, or he didn&rsquo;t
come this way,&rdquo; the ranger said in a low tone.</p>
<p>Madge sank down on an old log to rest. The
ranger stood beside her staring meditatively down
the trail. Suddenly he straightened, and Madge,
hearing the same sound, looked quickly up. She
stifled the exclamation upon her lips.</p>
<p>She could plainly hear the crackle of twigs underfoot.
Someone was coming down the trail! Madge
quietly arose and looked questioningly at the ranger.
His expression had not changed.</p>
<p>Then through the trees they glimpsed Clyde
Wendell. He was staggering under the burden of
his canoe, and with head bent low could not see the
two who awaited him in the clearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; Jack said challengingly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been
waiting for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With an exclamation of startled dismay, the
chemist straightened and allowed the canoe to slide
to the ground. He faced the two defiantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you want? I&rsquo;m on my way to
Bryson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I observe,&rdquo; Jack commented dryly. &ldquo;What
are you doing with the canoe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only borrowed it. I&rsquo;d have sent it back when I
got to Bryson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t considered wise to borrow government
canoes. But we&rsquo;ll let that pass for the time being.
Hand over the book!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What book?&rdquo; Wendell countered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one I see sticking out of your hip pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chemist&rsquo;s hand went involuntarily to his
pocket but he faced Jack with blazing eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not hand over what belongs to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Anne&rsquo;s book!&rdquo; Madge cried for she had seen
the cover. &ldquo;Clyde Wendell, you did steal it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chemist half turned as though to make a
dash back over the trail he had just come, but the
ranger caught him firmly by the shoulder and
wheeled him about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no you don&rsquo;t! Hand it over or I&rsquo;ll take it
by force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wendell looked searchingly at the ranger. &ldquo;See
here,&rdquo; he said in a conciliatory tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay for the
book and the canoe too. I meant no harm. I only
want to catch my train at Bryson. You see, I picked
up the book by accident&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll catch no train today,&rdquo; Jack interrupted
bluntly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going back to Loon Lake. Incidentally,
there&rsquo;s a matter of a board bill to settle.
Now hand over the book!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reluctantly, the chemist relinquished it. Jack
passed it on to Madge who hastily examined it to
see that no pages were missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew it contained the formula,&rdquo; she accused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the wildest accusation yet!&rdquo; the chemist
laughed derisively. &ldquo;You and that Fairaday girl
have built up a pretty story which you&rsquo;ve kidded
yourselves into believing is true. Fairaday never
owned a formula. It was an obsession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Move along!&rdquo; Jack ordered. &ldquo;Walk ahead of me
and don&rsquo;t try any tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge followed close behind. She was highly
elated at having regained possession of &ldquo;Kim.&rdquo; Yet
what if Anne should fail to bring out the secret
writing? Clyde seemed so confident they would not
succeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find some way to reveal the writing!&rdquo;
she resolved. &ldquo;At any rate, I&rsquo;ll not worry until after
we&rsquo;ve made another laboratory test.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><br />CHAPTER XV
<br /><i>What The Book Revealed</i></h2>
<p>Midnight lights burned brightly in the Fairaday
laboratory. A group of tense watchers, Madge and
Mr. Brownell, Jack, and Mr. and Mrs. Brady, stood
watching Anne who was busy at the work table.
Clyde Wendell, guarded by a forest ranger, sat
propped carelessly back in his chair, a look of
amused contempt on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s a failure,&rdquo; Anne said in a
subdued tone. She smiled bravely but her face was
wan. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve tested each page except the back
cover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack looked accusingly at Wendell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could tell us how to bring out that formula
if you would!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, if there were a formula,&rdquo; the chemist
retorted. &ldquo;Now that this nonsense is over, am I
free to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All eyes focused upon Anne as she gave the final
sheet the chemical test which had been applied to
the other pages. As she removed it from the iodine
bath a few minutes later, Madge, who was close at
her friend&rsquo;s side, bent closer. Scattered lines, at first
indistinct and unconnected, gradually as if by
magic, lengthened and conformed into written
characters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the formula!&rdquo; she cried exultingly.</p>
<p>Mr. Brownell moved nearer. His face, passive
until now, became animated. He studied the page
which Anne held up for his inspection and then
said quietly: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the genuine thing. Miss Fairaday,
I congratulate you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a few minutes Clyde Wendell was forgotten.
When Madge looked at him she saw that he
had lost his arrogant assurance. He arose and with
a gesture of submission faced Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You win. I didn&rsquo;t think Miss Fairaday could
bring out the writing. I suppose this means prison
for me. I&rsquo;m ready to leave whenever you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you do it?&rdquo; Madge asked. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you
explain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time, the chemist appeared slightly
ashamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;Mr. Fairaday
and I never clicked very well. He didn&rsquo;t trust me
and I resented it. At first I helped him with his rust
prevention experiments, then he began to work in
secret. I guessed that he had made an important
discovery. I watched him and learned that he had
written the formula in that book.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>He indicated the dismantled &ldquo;Kim,&rdquo; smiling
wryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before I had a chance to read the formula, Mr.
Fairaday discharged me. I found another job. Then
three months ago I lost it. I thought I&rsquo;d develop a
rust prevention formula of my own because I was
hard up for money. I found I couldn&rsquo;t do it. Then
I read of Mr. Fairaday&rsquo;s death and knowing that he
had never done anything with his formula in a
commercial way, I decided to come here and see
if I could get it. You know the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you were the one who entered the house
that night?&rdquo; Anne demanded. &ldquo;You were searching
for the book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I wasn&rsquo;t after the silver. I took that merely
to throw you off the track. I&rsquo;m not a common thief.
I don&rsquo;t know what made me try to steal the
formula. When a fellow&rsquo;s down and out&mdash;broke&mdash;well,
I guess things look different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne, Madge and Jack held a private conference.
Presently, Anne turned again to Clyde.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided not to testify against you,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Father wouldn&rsquo;t want me to. I have
the formula and that&rsquo;s all that really matters. I
believe you&rsquo;re sorry for what you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; the chemist mumbled, avoiding
her eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re more decent than I deserve.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As far as the canoe is concerned, the boys
will be willing to drop the charge,&rdquo; Jack added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Aunt Madge just said she wouldn&rsquo;t press
the board and room bill,&rdquo; Madge interposed. &ldquo;You
can pay it later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re free to go,&rdquo; Jack told him. &ldquo;Clear out
and be glad you got off so easily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the chemist had left, the atmosphere became
more friendly. Anne refused to talk business
that night but the following day she conferred
with Mr. Brownell and to the delight of her friends
sold the formula for a sum which guaranteed her
a modest income for life. Her first act was to pay
off the mortgage on her house and island, and then,
to Jake Curtis&rsquo; bitter anger, she refused to even
discuss a sale with him. Mr. Brownell had taken a
great liking to Loon Lake and upon learning that
Anne intended to live with an aunt in the city, he
offered her a price for her property which left her
quite dazed. Madge urged her to sell, and after brief
negotiations, she arranged all details of the transaction
to her satisfaction.</p>
<p>With business matters cleared away, Anne spent
a few weeks at the lodge before leaving for the east.
The days were crammed with good times and it
was difficult for the girls to say goodbye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I owe everything to you,&rdquo; Anne said for perhaps
the hundredth time, as they stood at the railway
station awaiting the train. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget
this summer and all you&rsquo;ve done for me, Madge. I&rsquo;ll
come back and see you often too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>The train that carried Anne to New York
brought Madge a letter&mdash;an invitation to spend
two weeks at Cheltham Bay, cruising aboard the
luxurious Burnett yacht. As she dispatched an enthusiastic
acceptance, she little dreamed of the
exciting adventure that awaited her. The story of
Madge&rsquo;s queer reception at Cheltham Bay is recounted
in the second volume of this series, entitled:
&ldquo;<i>The Deserted Yacht</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack French did not accept the news of Madge&rsquo;s
intended departure very cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve scarcely had a chance to see you this
summer,&rdquo; he protested as they walked alone one
evening. &ldquo;Here you&rsquo;re leaving in a week and I&rsquo;d
made all sorts of plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know you&rsquo;ll be too busy to even miss me,&rdquo;
Madge teased.</p>
<p>She was surprised at the look which came into
Jack&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll miss you like everything, and you know it
too, imp! Since the day you came to Loon Lake, just
an undersized, freckled kid, you&rsquo;ve been the only
girl for me. You&rsquo;re the sweetest&mdash;&rdquo; he broke off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; Madge urged, laughing.</p>
<p>Jack shook his head and smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, until you grow a few years you must take
it for granted. But while you&rsquo;re at Cheltham Bay
you might think of me once in a while. And don&rsquo;t
be too surprised if you see me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took her hand and together they went down
to the lake to watch the moon rise over the spruce
ridges.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
